# Notes

## PhD

- Quite excited about expansion microscopy, and the possibility of using it to study the brain.
- Mouse brain has about 85 million neurons, and billions to trillions of synapses. We might sample about 0.001% of the neurons in the brain.
- Rat brain has about 200 million neurons, billions to trillions of synapses.
- Human brain has about 86 billion neurons, and trillions of synapses.
- Don't forget about diffusion based imaging to explot the property that water molecules move along white-matter bundles faster than they do against them.
- Mutual information is a measure of the statistical dependence or information shared between two random variables. It quantifies how much knowing the value of one variable reduces the uncertainty about the other. In other words, it measures how much information is gained about one variable by observing the other.
