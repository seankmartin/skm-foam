* Small image formatting errors in places, such as cuttoff text, or images not being centered.
* In one set of Python code, the code is not correctly indented (it will work, but it does not perform the intended function).
* License mismatch, Simuran is now MIT licensed, not GPL.
* In the signed version, the date bled into another page of the thesis.
* Typo on page 95. subicular the LFP.
* Typo on page 124, and they process inputs.
* Page 101 describes a different method to what Figure 5.6 is showing (TODO check which is correct).
