LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively

* Use your writing to help you to think. However, when you do this it does not help someone
reading it.
* When reading something you slow down -> Misunderstand -> Aggravated -> Stop.
* Heirarchy - Valuable -> Persuasive -> organised -> clear.
* Writing is not conveying your ideas, instead it is changing their ideas.
* Do valuable work, not new or original knowledge.
* EG https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/5/7046/files/2014/10/UnivChic_WritingProg-1grt232.pdf
Nonetheless. Widely. Accepted. However. Although. Inconsistent. Reported. Anomaly.
Widely, accepted and reported indicate that a community is interested in this.
However. But. Although. Inconsistent. Although. These create instability (tension, challenge,
contradiction, red flags).
15 minutes a week, take an article in your field. Go through and circle every word in writing
that is creating value to the readers. In this way, create a word bank that you can work from.
Every community has a code, a set of words which communicate value.
In your own work, do the exact same thing, if you can't find 10 words in the first two
paragraphs, you go to the word list and you drop them in.
* The way to do it is to praise them, and then give a very small but, and then argue why they are
wrong. That is what an introduction does. You have to take a risk! If all you are trying to do is
add a new thing then they won't want to listen. Identify the people of power in your
community and give them what they want.
* You challenge the community inside the terms of the community.
* The function is to move the conversation forward, not to preserve an idea indefinitely. It is not
permanence.
* Donâ€™t start with a generalisation and then move in to a specific case, and then back out to a
generalisation. You instead discuss a problem that is really relevant to the reader. The problem
is something that academics want to understand, or a problem that people want to fix.
* Problem->Solution. As such your thesis is only a solution to a problem if the problem is
described. Generally the problem is shown to be instable (instead of the language of
consistency that is usually used). Also the problem has cost and benefits. The instability
imposes a cost on the reader, or if the instability, is it is solved, poses a benefit to the reader.
Often a journal will prefer the benefit or the cost approach.
* Lit review as a PhD student, you don't know your readers.
* Be careful of using gap words.
* New knowledge doesn't mean valuable knowledge. Neither does original or clear writing.
* No one cares what you think. They care what they think. Write to change minds.
* Knowledge can be imagined as a conversation where some topics are kept and some are
discarded.
