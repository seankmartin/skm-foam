Very interesting article. Lots of analysis performed on thousands on cells, see [[open-data]] for description of data.
Some new-ish to me methods employed also. E.g. Peer prediction and SVCA.
Interesting hypothesis also that there exists a multidimensional representation of behaviour in visual cortex and that previously reported "noise" during stimulus presentations may in face be behaviourally driven.
