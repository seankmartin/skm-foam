# Prepare for viva

## Suggested steps

1. Review the university policy and viva procedure.
2. Review your own thesis, with familiarity of your main sources, explain and defend your methods, and be able to explain your results. Additionally, be able to explain the limitations of your thesis and implications of your work.
3. If in person, try to visit the room where the viva will take place to familiarise yourself with the space.
4. Review the work of your examiners. Particularly the most recent work of your external examiner - this is likely to be the most relevant to your thesis, and they are generally the expert in your field.

## Question answering strategies

## Resources

- [Videos about the viva](https://port.sas.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1927)
- [PhD Viva guide](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/media/graduatestudies/files/phdvivaguide/phd_viva_guide.pdf)

## To investigate

- The possibility of a mock viva.

## Common opening questions

- Please explain how you came upon this research topic and why you chose to work on it.
- Please explain what you have achieved in this thesis.

## Tips

- Read through your thesis thoroughly about a week before the viva and think through it actively.
- Even though the examiners will carefully read your thesis, it is unlikely that they know more about it than you.
- It can be a good idea to brush up on the examiners research close to the event to re-familiarise yourself with their work and where they might be coming from with their questions.
- Before the event (and into the future), come up with a way to describe your thesis in less than 5 sentences.
