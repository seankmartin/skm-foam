## Plan at 17-09-2021

There are 14 weeks left until Christmas. This would give me time for a good crack at a new project.

## Plan at 29-09-2021

Beth's project is largely finished up, I just need to finish methods and let them know.
So figuring out the last steps for thesis now to do my final projects.

For tomorrow. In the morning I have the oxford Neuroscience at 9:30, so I need to be ready for that.
As such, get up and do urgent things at desk, but be ready to come back for 9:30.

## Plan at 01-10-2021

Gather together the interesting datasets, and how they are accessed - this might lead to me an integrative style study - which would definitely be adding value.
Check Mark Humphries the spike paper on an integrative approach for inspiration.
