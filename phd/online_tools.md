# Online tools

## Look interesting

- [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender) - very pretty looking vis, and recently updated.
- [brainglobe](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-atlasapi) - atlases in multiple formats, would be good to look at for exploration! Note that brainglobe have two repos now that are interesting, so should look at them in general.
- [Spectral connectivity](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/spectral_connectivity) - interesting LFP connectivity, could maybe try on Beth's data.
- [CI analysis](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) - looks interesting.
- [Matrix time series](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy) - Stumpy looks a good general library.
