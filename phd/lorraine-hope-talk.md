# Lorraine hope on memory and investigation

## Notes 

- Memory accounts can have loss of information, be prone to distortion and error, prone to incompleteness.
- An interviewer can uninenentionally influence the interviewee's memory.
- They give blank pieces of paper to people for them to recount what happened in their events, but what could you do differently (i.e. there is not an encoding issue with the memory - you are co-operative and the memory was encoded correctly, why might this piece of information not come out correctly?)
- Her work has been on creating better reporting tools to extract the information.
- A good way to organise the information is by using a timeline (when you are doing long interviews).
- Direct questions in time-pressured situations, what about this? TWO PART PROCESS - part 1, put both parties on the same page. part 1 - I-RELATE acryonym. part 2 is to ask slightly open questions.
- There is hugely different cultural differences in reporting norms.
- You can just give people hooks to get their memories going.

## Possible questions (for speaker)

- Application of this work to other domains?
- Mechanistacally, perhaps part of why people do so much is that they don't need intervention? But they also have some idea of structure.
- Could the mnemonic be too much, compared to the overall method of part 1 - introduce, relate, set the goals. Part 2 - open questions.
- Would the timeline help online?
