Was unwell yesterday with my ears, and spent today getting them fixed.
Feel quite unwell and off balance though, doc said that should pass soon.

For tomorrow morning, I need to do the following:

1. Last read through open data and send it on.
2. Last read through summary and send it on.
3. Read / finish reading the paper on connectivity.
4. Watch the video from Allen institute on the new section. (neural something)
