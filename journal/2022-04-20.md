Considered the NMA course; problem, I think I know too much to be a student, and being a TA would take up too much of my time for what I can currently allow.
However, it did remind me that I wanted to brush up on some basic neuroscience surrounding brain regions, etc
I have two ebooks related to this that I want to go through and I also want to start up my brain explorer project.

This further reminds me that I need to set aside some time to go through my github repos and to also update my website.
Perhaps the best thing is to set aside a bit of time at night?
Anyway I need to review the daily plan that I currently have as it is not fully working out since COVID.

Need to do further work on the NWB https://www.nwb.org/.
