This link has good info on the NWB writing process and some info on the allensdk api https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/domain/brain_observatory.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-domain-brain-observatory-py

I want to check on SLD how to find the recordings (should be available from the blackboard module, so probably easiest to find it there.)

I guess I should check back on this later on https://community.brain-map.org/t/is-there-a-public-facing-version-of-the-allensdk-methods-description-mentioned-on-the-read-the-docs-website/1610

Another idea which could feed into the Allen analysis https://www-nature-com.elib.tcd.ie/articles/nature26159/figures/1

Should check this out https://github.com/MouseLand/rastermap

Good notebook here https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/examples/nb/visual_behavior_load_ophys_data.html
