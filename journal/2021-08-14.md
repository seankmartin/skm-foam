The last two days friends have been staying from Switzerland, so work is a little bit out of whack. As such I've not been able to do any coding. I have been doing some reading though when I can.
I have some thoughts from this reading that I need to summarise, and some new papers to look at based on it. When friends are gone, will finish off the code for Beth's paper.
