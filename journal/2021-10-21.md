Found out today that there is a P-P plot which compares CDFs as an alternative to the more widely used Q-Q plot.

Example of an executable Elife paper here https://elifesciences.org/articles/61277/executable

## Thesis ideas

1. Bradley Voytek
2. Make my open data paper an executable one like above. 
3. Explicitly deal with the over 3mil peer reviewed (and more non!) in nscience? - source https://datascience.ucsd.edu/i-am-data-science/i-am-data-science-bradley-voytek/

## Mail with Shane

This came from a discussion here. https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/2018/11/29/a-controversy-about-whether-brain-waves-play-a-functional-role/  http://www.rdgao.com/epiphenomenal-oscillations/

I think I'm inclined to the email view below - that LFPs are readouts of summed activity, rather than causal, but I don't think this means they're epiphenomenal either. Waves in the ocean are readouts of the activity of the moon, wind and underwater activity - but they mean something!

Very interesting, I found some responses to the second article on some digging - and I think the comment at the end of this mail from MV mimics the idea I came across in one of Buzsaki's works (I've genuinely forgotten which one). In this sense, LFPs are a byproduct. I am certain that Buzsaki's work did not claim LFP does nothing, he has a whole book on rhythms in the brain (which I have currently stolen from the lab ðŸ˜®) - a bit of a dense book though! In our case, I'd have to do some digging into their arguments and our own results, but I think this view would essentially say that enough the brain is still intact and functioning close to normal post ATNx to generate these regular rhythms. How these rhythms link to/ influence spikes post ATNx would be the question in that case I guess
