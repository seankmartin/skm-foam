Going to start off the morning with reading Models of the Mind and the spike to gather final ideas.

Since last thinking about it, I also have the idea of comparing spike population dynamics to lfp dynamics.
I need to start to prep for my confirmation meeting in March, easier to get it out of the way now.
Have a template in my thesis folder and will work on this more.

Need to check paper Matheus sent on tomorrow.
Also have ideas from books that I have written down on paper but need to transcribe to here.
