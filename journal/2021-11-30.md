Idea for a little project - take the paper recommender from Claudio and make it voice based.

In the morning, gathering everything together for Shane.
In the afternoon, think I will get my literature review together for this project.

Check out https://bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/cell-atlas/ in more detail.
This has full 3D positions of cells so I would not necessarily need to do randomly if the numbers match.

I need to read the paper Shane sent on to me today about if the brain cares about averages.

Was updating lit rev in the afternoon
