Learnt a lot about logging! The root logger is always used. See SIMURAN and py_utils for a possible way to set up different loggers.
This is likely a good start, could probably use some better classes though.

There is an interesting point from this paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34283328/ about artifact detection in LFP.
Note though that it can't currently replace artifacts, currently it can just use ML to detect them.
The best performed seemed to be using a CNN.
