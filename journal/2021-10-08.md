Interesting papers to look at from Mark Humphries - check them out later on!
These are in chapter 7.

Also looking again at trying to get a demo set up because the neuromatch academy is on again on Dec first with deadline for abstract the end of this month.

This looks interesting for documentation, I should keep an eye on it https://www.gitbook.com/?utm_source=content&utm_medium=trademark&utm_campaign=federicoclaudi.

I need to make a new repository for just regular tools I use! So for instance every monday I can open it, and I can run refy for papers.
It can even help me with time etc. Just need to place it all in one place. Will be a process over time though.
