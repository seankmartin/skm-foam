Good idea today for the software.

Need to look at these tomorrow:

[CI analysis](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/caiman/caiman.html#analysistools-caiman)
[Elephant](https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[pynapple](https://github.com/PeyracheLab/pynapple) is interesting.

Further [NWB](https://nwb-overview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro_to_nwb/3_basic_neurodata_types.html) familiarity.

What would [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html) provide me and how do allen use it?
