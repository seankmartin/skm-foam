Yesterday was sick, had to go docs. Back to work today.

Going to start with open data read through once more. Then review thesis structure, and then some thesis writing.

Spent the morning with a bit of a nightmare! My citations just wouldn't work. Eventually got it fixed, and moved the backend to biber. This has resulted in much better looking and easier citations though, so perhaps all for the best!
