## Achieved

1. Fixed the bug preventing SFC calculation properly in muscimol data.

## Notes

Listed here are some things to grab for Beth's paper.

1. Power spectra in SUB RSC and CA1 (Matheus).
2. STA and SFC in SUB RSC and muscimol data.
3. FOOF analysis to accompany 1.
4. T-maze coherence and decoding.

The t-maze decoding and coherence first verions are done, just take a while to run.

For tomorrow need to start accumulating the figures and orgnaise the paper a bit so that I can tip away at the paper and think about it over the weekend.

## Time worked

5 hours, mostly on coding.
