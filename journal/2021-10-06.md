In the morning, reading to try and get a plan of this experiment.

In the afternoon, experimenting with the GUI that I am trying to make.
Need to revisit the idea about the LFP and replay.

A very good an in depth list of tutorials here on making a node editor using QT https://www.blenderfreak.com/tutorials/node-editor-tutorial-series/
This has lead to the python package nodeeditor, which I should look at.

Alternatively, I have figured out how to dynamically add to a dear pygui.
So a node editor might be possible

I'll list the requirements for a node editor here, and then can move them later:

1. Dynamically adding nodes either via another window or a popup menu.
2. Support custom nodes.
3. Set parameters on nodes and use these for computation.
4. Show plots on right click.
5. Show tooltips of variables.


Interesting application from Allen to predict what results will translate from mouse to human http://mouse2man.org/.

Need to convert SIMURAN logging to rich https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich

Check out what this can do for me, and the improvements over Rich https://github.com/FedeClaudi/pyinspect

Keep an eye on this for updates https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual

This could be good for new papers https://fedeclaudi.github.io/index.html#os-projects.
