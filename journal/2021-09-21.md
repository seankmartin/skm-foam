## Notes

MNE now has an interesting method for automatic detection of artefacts in ICA - uses kurtosis and variation -seems interesting.

For the next few days I was looking at implementation of this, and what the results are like. The automatic detection is very interesting, but does not always work well.
Realistically an approach like spike sorting would work best, whereby there is an automatic step followed by manual curation of the results, and visualisations to accompany.
However, such a program (like spike sorting) would take quite a while to develop.

Overall, I won't use ICA for the paper, but I can put a nice section in my thesis in on.

Picking up from here on the following Tuesday where I am trying to plan better for my thesis what could be in it.
