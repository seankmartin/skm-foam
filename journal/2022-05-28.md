COSYNE has a lot of information about the last meeting they had online, should check it out here https://www.cosyne.org/.
Also need to look tomorrow at making some weekly summaries and incorporating some recent information into my TODO list.
Finally, I need to check how my time is lining up currently with the plan I made a few months ago, and update the plan if needed.

Lastly, I should update my article about pynwb to include accessing the data and adding custom tables to the data, as well as the nwb-widgets package.
