The last few days I have been working to get my demo working for the UI.

It looks quite good at the moment, but I'm have a few things to clean up - however nearly at the end.
It has actual behaviour, but needs work to be very useful, however, demo is pretty good.

Things to note that I should check out:

- https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ghostwriter.html for automatic unit tests.
- Pyjama python conference.
- Still need to check out the conference this year on comp neuro.
- I should look at the citations of some of the neuropixels recordings to evaluate what has been done with them.
