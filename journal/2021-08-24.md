Yesterday was bummed out. Getting back today.

## Priorities

1. Muscimol analysis - do SFC over time (since it is all that is of interest). Theta for e.g. will likely change in sleep. -- outcome, SFC figures over time. Also a plot like the coherence from last paper.
2. T-maze (just run the code and also see how Matheus is getting on).
3. Start making figures in inkscape.
4. Update the paper.
5. Do the online blackboard course.

## Achieved

1. Synthesised ideas around what to do with the rejected connectivity paper.
2. Completed the research integrity course, and uploaded my previous result for integrity part 1. Need to double check they will accept that.

## Notes

For tomorrow to finish off task 1, I need to do the following.
1. Before running make a sure a back up of the cell mapping is taken in case of problems.
2. Parse the list of muscimol cells into a list and then run SFC on this list.
3. Compile together the output.

## Hours worked

5 hours, mostly on writing and reading.
