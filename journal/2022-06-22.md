# Wednesday, June, 2022

A little bit of time off last few days.

## Plan

- Start with T-maze conversion and analysis for the LFP experiment.
- Check spike LFP output.
- Writing thesis to get back into it.
- Possibly sleep analysis for LFP.
- Hypothesis tests.

## Achieved

- Something broke with the OSF upload, I have a folder with all the data that needs to be uploaded.
- I can ask OSF if something broke, or alternatively I can zip these folders and upload as single files to OSF.
