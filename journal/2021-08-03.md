## Plan

1. Emails
2. Finalise results

## Notes

## Achieved

- Cleared up with Beth why not all LFP available in some recordings - due to settings issue in screening.
- Fixed things in the code that I needed to finish off. E.g. wrong labelling of axes, median instead of mean, etc. Had a list.
- Make a list of all recordings where not all LFP signals are available. Indicate which ones can't be used.
- For tomorrow. Finish off a lot of the analyses and start the final runs! Update paper a bit too.
