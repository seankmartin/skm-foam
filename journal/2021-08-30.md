Didn't get too much done as was not well. Listened to some of the conference though.

## Notes

Benjamin Hayden (in monkeys) did not find much a difference between the function of the cells recorded in different parts of the PFC.
As such, (given there is also debate over boundaries there it seems), perhaps PFC is much of the same.
Oddly enough, despite the recent review on the population doctrine from Hayden, they are still doing single cell level analysis. Odd and interesting.
