In the morning I need to do a bit of practice on talking, and I also need to look at the thing that Shane sent on.
Further, I need to really get the code together in SIMURAN to work with old axona stuff too.
Also need to see what is wrong with the IBL download from the reproducibility paper.

Also need to create a new presentation roughly about what I do.
