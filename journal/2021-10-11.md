At the point of having a decent demo. Will work on requirements in turn, and then on datasets.
Can I present something at Neuromatch??

Achieved:

- Can create custom nodes and link them together.
- Made a factory for nodes (still need to make an abstract factory).
- Allowed showing plots of images (though they are too large currently for the screen).
- Working basics


I should go through some of this daily to make sure that I am familiar with the design patterns presented https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/
From a short reading though, I likely need a factory to create nodes, and a factory of factories to create these node creating factories (woof).

Pretty much at a working demo!

TODO to get working demo:

1. Add tooltips.
2. Make the nodes meaningful (e.g. search for a file).
3. Do a computation.
4. Show an actual result.
