Listening to the oxford neuroscience talk in the morning.
Things presented:

1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8315304/ - Thalamic cerebullum pathway to motor cortex
2. Superior colliculus and role in sensorimotor communication - Duan, Pagan, Piet et al in Nat Neuro 2021. They used a model to try and replicate the results, and check which circuit features are essential for executive control. 2nd talk, Duan, Pan et al. Nat Comms 2021
3. Beta oscillations (12 - 35Hz) are a ubiquitous feature of the healthy motor cortex. PD loss of dopamine in Striatum due to death of neurons in Substantia Nigra pars compacta. Lesioned coherence increases in 6-OHDA lesioned animals (didn't cathc the region). Basal ganglia neurons become patholigically synchronised to cortical beta oscillations in Parkinson's Disease. Charlotte Stagg applying gamma during theta oscillations.

I feel I'm building a hypothesis here: coherence and correlation is bad?
From IT, I feel it could certainly be provable.
What about the need for many spikes?
And what would be my specific hypothesis to test?
Plus, if I'm saying coherence and corr is "bad", then I think I'm saying that the less variance described by PCA the better.
