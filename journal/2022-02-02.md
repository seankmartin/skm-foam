Working today on getting conenctions code finished and working on planning and writing in the meantime while this runs.
Going to first go through notes here and make a proper plan for the next little while. Also will synthesise my last few weeks which I have not yet done.

For the connections code, it seems that depth 1 works well with probes, but depth 2 does not. I will check depth 2 quickly on a smaller example, just in case it is a size issue.
