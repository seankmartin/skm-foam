Have not really taken many notes the last while. To update on what is going on.

1. Finished review of connections paper and sent it on.
2. Finished of CLA paper and sent it on.
3. Finished draft of progress report and sent it on.

That means that I have the following to do now:

1. Integrate information into thesis and sent it on with progress report.
2. Create a short presentation for my progress report. (consider answering their questions - esp about human data)
