Mission - How does our brain build understanding of the complex world around us to guide the flexible behaviours that address our biological needs.
Defined neuron types interacting across the whole brain and body.
Slide in the talk that shows the allen mouse projections in a nice fashion.

Very interesting thought to record neurons (AND their types simultaneously)
How are signals propagated through neural circuits.

Some ideas in my rocketbook for continuing. I'll note them down here elsewhere.
Note the brainrender examples.
