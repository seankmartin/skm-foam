Yesterday, I was working on data finding for prototype of last project (see [[open-data]]).

Today I will mostly be contributing to the same. Note that I also ordered two 4TB hard drives.
Need to follow up with Cian.

I was looking more at DANDI today, they have an open day on Nov 1 if I think they would be useful for my research in general.

Check out https://alyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Consider laying out figures for papers like this in future https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ophys_ephys_comparison_paper
I already have pickles and csv files, which could be stored elsewhere and then just plotted. Hmmm.

I should look from some DOIs for the datasets I have found in open data, and look for places that use them.

[open-data]: ../projects/open-data "Open Data"
