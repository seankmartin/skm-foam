1. Check contents of the drive I brought home.
2. Run the Allen for a single recording through new_main.

These last two can be for later on.
3. Write down some thoughts about model-free, comp-neuro, etc.
4. Start thinking about a tutorial for neural data analysis. (Big notebook in SIMURAN for e.g.)

Need to check the citations of the 2P visual dataset.

Check this out https://refactoring.guru/. I picked up the two books from here about refactoring and about design patterns.

NOTE This needs to come earlier.
Need to debug explore_ophys.py file - same as explore ephys - blocking me from downloading more data!
Maybe best is to check the manual download instructions.

Calcium imaging picks up more burst like events.

Really really useful to note:
NeuroDataReHack
Generate new insights from existing neurophysiology data through secondary analysis
October 3-5, 2022, Allen Institute, Seattle

Include some wirings in the thesis.

NWB has a youtube channel so I can check the vids that I missed https://www.youtube.com/c/NeurodataWithoutBorders/videos.
