## Achieved

Lots of work on finalising results.
Also did some final bug fixing and sanity checking of the code and results

## Notes for tomorrow

1. There is something strange in the t-maze analysis. The plots and the stats are not matching up for the theta and the coherence results. Need to fix this for obvious reasons. Will need to update all JASP files using this data.
2. Need to check the STA muscimol analysis and see if this all lines up Ok too.
3. Need to rerun the Spike LFP in CTRL/Lesion and check the output. Also check if the JASP is up to date at this point.
4. First thing in morning fix the problems with spike LFP output.
