Just finished up a few projects, so going to launch back into reading/writing and getting SIMURAN + last project done!

Need to check the citations to the dataset I am planning to use to see if someone has already done the same / similar thing with it.
Search for conferences that I could attend that have grants attached.

Check list of TODO here.

I might have an old list about of conferences that are related (maybe even in onenote)
