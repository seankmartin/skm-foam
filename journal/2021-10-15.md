Got the demo finished today and made a gif of it!
Not much coding done, but a lot of reading about code and how to put up the gif.

I ended up using OBS along with ezgif (which are actually a really good combo.) - keep in mind for future!

Finally, I have figured out (from an interview with Guido van Rossum) - that getters and setters (and even making too many classes) is not a clever thing to do.
Tuples are faster than lists, and methods are expensive to call.

Over the weekend I need to check some data sources for this final project I want to do.
