https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels still seems promising along with Carandini Harris data for open data to analyse.
See citation policy here https://alleninstitute.org/legal/citation-policy/

Need to finish up the open data / correlation information sheet.
Then move on to some thesis writing to get a better idea of where I stand.
Then the changes to the paper for WT would be best.

Check the references to e.g. the Siegle 2021 to make sure no one has answered my question yet.
