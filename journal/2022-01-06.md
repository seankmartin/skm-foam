I have discovered where my code is not matching - it is between the code that is for the subsampled matrix and the code that is for the full matrix - the two of these don't line up.

Code won't run at the moment, computer seems too clogged so will have to try again tomorrow fresh.
To try and speed up the process, maybe I can save a smaller version of the original matrix?
