## Plan

- Finish off coding bits for Beth's paper.
- Get more T-maze times.

## Achieved

1. Tested a list of openfield recordings for LFP analysis based on missing signals. Balanced to have same number from each animal. However, based on visual inspection can't use lots of the habituation data because it is very noisy.
2. Looking at papers for formal speed LFP. Seems they do exact same as me, so little change needed.

## Notes

- Interesting paper here from Carandini on LFP https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730490/. However, I feel they have been slightly selective in their reporting here. The real kicker is in the conclusion, but seems only mentioned once. "To conclude, our quantitative estimate of spatial scale indicates that LFPs are more local than often recognized. LFP signals can faithfully report the selectivity of cortical populations **but only if the underlying map varies on a similar or larger scale**" - bold my own emphasis. As such, I reckon that in a mouse or rat it remains rather non-local. There is more volume conduction than in the cat brain used here (size etc.), and esp in the limbic system, there are often a range of different responses from cells (much less in sync than visual system anyway, that is for sure).
