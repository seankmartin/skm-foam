Starting back today after COVID. Planning to get straight into coding and writing.

Will look at conferences later on too.

* https://forum.fens.org/

Things to bring up and things to look at (will check TODO list here later on):

* Conferences and dissemination of research (grants?)
* Literature review possible from my thesis as a paper?
* What would go in a section of LFP and including Hams stuff?
* Make a more detailed plan for going forward from here.

I forgot that I had this https://gin.g-node.org/seankmartin/SIMURAN_Test_Data

Also note this dataset https://gin.g-node.org/NIN/V1_V4_1024_electrode_resting_state_data
from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359161666_1024-channel_electrophysiological_recordings_in_macaque_V1_and_V4_during_resting_state

And check this out better for working with the data https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
The paper actually lists a lot of other tools so it is very important
Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org/get-started/)

Also need to check this out for metadata http://g-node.github.io/python-odml/

Could I convert to snakemake or something like that at the end??

Trying to figure out how to make this actually useful at the moment.
