## Plan

## Achieved

Research into the connectivity. So the null mouse brain model does actually have N synpases built in by the looks, they have just condensed that into a connection matrix (which I think is only 1 or 0 based).

In the morning I need to write down a proper plan for when I can be done the PhD and what the deadlines for these things might be, and then print that off.
I also need to look for my notebook.
Then I need to make note of the things I need to do in the coming days.
Email tomorrow re this.

## TODO

- Check the neuron count from https://bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/cell-atlas/ and compare it to the count that is in the mouse brain connection matrix.
- If they match, I can reach out and ask if there is any relationship between the c matrix order and these cell positions. (I think they will.)
- If no match between position, can I use this? https://github.com/BlueBrain/Long-range-micro-connectome/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.pdf
- Double check the connection matrix is only 0 or 1.
- Write a notebook example
