Today I was reading papers about population neuroscience and techniques for analysis.

Humphries has an interesting paper arguing for more use of network neuro in neuroscience.
Also has a paper which was a population study on spike dynamics which I need to pay more attention to, to see if I could do something similar for the neuronal populations in newer recording sets.

So tomorrow I think I can start to put some of these ideas into practice and start coming up with ideas for next steps. Would be worth consulting my two books on this as well.
