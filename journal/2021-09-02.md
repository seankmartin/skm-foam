## Achieved

1. Ran FOOOF on CA1 data.
2. Fixed problem with spike LFP saving of data. Should now be able to do final stats.
3. Fixed t-maze output of coherence being slightly wrong.
4. Including many methods in paper and doing final runs.

## Notes

1. Redo the power spectra analysis with the wider FOOOF range.
2. Redo the coherence to make sure not using LSR7.
3. Redo all SFC (don't need to overwrite) with despine.

I think I need to run all results fresh as I have already found an old run that I thought was new.
On the bright side, I couldn't tell the difference so the new control hasn't impacted results.

Do the stats in Python AND JASP to make sure they agree and that I have not made mistakes.
Run muscimol_sta and summarise tasks again. (first thing tomorrow)
