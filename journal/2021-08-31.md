## Properties

1. Get in touch with Matheus.
2. Gather together stats and figures and update paper.
3. Decide on next steps to take for PhD (will list down some and pick best)

## Notes

David Leopold - how does the brain operate under natural conditions.
Uri Hasson - 80% simple system of overfitting and interpolation (statistics, like DL) in the brain. Then 20% which must be covered like other things, like thinking.
A bit like DL can cover our everyday things. Maybe our brain does similar for these. And then more complex on top of that (maybe from interaction of simple networks even).

## Achieved

Figured out where matheus is and gathered together many results. Putting them together now.
