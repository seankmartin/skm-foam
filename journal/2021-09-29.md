Finished off the work on Beth's stuff yesterday, though things were a little slow as dog was spayed on Monday.

Today, in the morning I was reading some papers.
No major ideas found, but I did discover that the idea of creating a model of a cell type E.G. 
HD cell, and then applying this to robotics is a interesting thing. The model was quite fast too. 
Biologically inspired models again. However, the model was really quite simple, taking as input angular velocity (how much left or right movement), and then using this to update the HD. With a good angular velocity, simply integrating the HD would give a good result.
The model was only useful in the presence of a noisy sensory (probably like brain is good with noise).

Then moved on to trying to plan last experiment for PhD.
