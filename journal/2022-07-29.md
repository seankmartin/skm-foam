## Plan

Work on updating the connectivity paper. Then review recent notes.

## Achieved

Been working on the idea of the skewed distribution.
It seems the reviewer is right, as I would have a subnetwork of all neurons which send connections.
Then if that original network is large, this net is a small subset of a large network.
And then it may not properly follow the stats of the original network.
Is that what is going wrong?
Anyway, will need to write this information into the paper.
And also to the reviewer.
Still need to check recent notes though - but am getting through the TODO of the review.
