## Plan for today

Time for about 4 pomodoros. So roughly four tasks.

1. Integrate changes from Shane into paper (latex too? - I think yes?).
2. Check upcoming conferences and make a list to show Shane.
3. Define the role of my software tool.
4. Check my literature review to see if it is distinct from what is already out there.
