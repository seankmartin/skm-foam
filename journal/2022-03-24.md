## Plan for today

Time for about 4 pomodoros. So roughly four tasks.

1. Integrate changes from Shane into paper (latex too? - I think yes?).
2. Check upcoming conferences and make a list to show Shane.
3. Define the role of my software tool.
4. Check my literature review to see if it is distinct from what is already out there.
5. ER paper review.

Some of these will bleed into tomorrow, but I have task 1 done enough to show on Monday.

Moving old code out of SIMURAN and into neuro-tools

Was looking at snakemake and tutorial at end of day as well as SIMURAN project usage.
