Working on thesis, NMC, and connections.

Picked out a few interesting things from NMC, but note that the flash talks seem to be viewable at any time.

For the connections paper, I finished intersecting the probes with cells, and completed the visualization of the whole thing.
Some results from this vis are in my thesis figures folder under my PhD folder.
