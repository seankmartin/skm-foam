## Plan

- Fix how slow the shuffling of spikes is in STA and SFC.
- Continue to get through list for Beth LFP

## Achieved

- Fixed the shuffling. Still slow, but a bit more manageable. Further improvements?
- Listed out the muscimol recordings, will start to test running them. First list the files to make sure not missing anything.
- Performed all of the ATNx CA1 theta analysis. Looks fine but might need a summary plot. My SIMURAN code works well with a mounted online system.
