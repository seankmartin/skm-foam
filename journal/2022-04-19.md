Back to work after the Easter weekend!

Have a look at this - they plan to open source all materials https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/2022-flatiron-machine-learning-x-science-summer-school/

The simon's foundation flatiron institute launched groups at the start of the year in [statistical](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/statistical-analysis-of-neural-data/) and [AI data analysis](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neuroai-and-geometry/)

Can use this for types on older python https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/
