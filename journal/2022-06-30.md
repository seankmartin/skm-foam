## Plan

## Achieved

1. Thesis writing and adding more information on the limbic system section.
2. Fixed the lfp conversion process.
3. Updated the burst analysis function and placed it in my thesis reproduce section.

## TODO still

1. Run the burst analysis after removing fast spiking cells and consider updating the plots.
2. Consider theta-modulated cells.
3. Consider replacing the plots in thesis with smaller dots.
4. Finalise spike LFP for muscimol and non-muscimol.

## For tomorrow

Specifics:

1. PhDThesis, burst_analysis.py - there seems to be data missing for one of the experiments - check this out.
2. atn-sub-lfp-workflow - the nwbfile is not showing up properly in plot_spike_lfp (see the merge in main). This may be due to the input file setup.
