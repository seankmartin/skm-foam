Starting off with looking at human data and reading.

I need to start writing out the population level techniques - have some of these in lit review.
Might not be any harm to even make a table style of these in my thesis TBH.

Writing out some hypotheses today and reading papers. Note - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.15.460545v1
This could be interesting to look at more if considering the corr=decreased performance on tasks idea.
ni et al. science 2018 also.
