## Plan

Coding and thesis writing.
Last few days was pondering over the connectivity paper.

## Achieved

- Fixed unreadable processed nwbfile.
- Fixed spike LFP plot for openfield.
- Created csv of tmaze information to start the conversion process with.
- Read paper on brain and averages (consider the relation to LFP).

## TODO

- Check if no HD will be ok in the t-maze conversion process.
- Check Spike-lfp muscimol.
- Grab all .png images recursively from Ham's data as well as .set files that have .bin file in the same place. See where this would go.
- Also check the mappings in cla analysis.
