# Tuesday, June, 2022

There is currently a problem with the osfclient upload whereby it complains about no new_file_url.
I will leave it for a few days to see if the OSF calms down and it happens to work.
Otherwise, I will have to figure out an alternative.
For the moment, can test with `osf_upload.py -u`

## Plan

See [[2022-06-13]] for information, as only got planning done yesterday - coding is focus today.

## Achieved

* Completed the lfp plot and fixed normalising outlier signals.
* Spike LFP in progress but need to fix the conversion step.
* Improved OSF code but there is a problem with the upload process currently.
* Brushed up on UML.
