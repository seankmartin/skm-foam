Seems that I may not be able to use copies of NWBfiles due to this issue:
https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/1223

Trying instead to directly append to the data. This works, though perhaps is not the preference.

Ok, have a good chunk of the snakemake working.
Need to update this tomorrow so that all the old functionality is there.
And then I can work to clean up the files.
