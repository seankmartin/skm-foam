# 2021 week 40

Feature demo for SIMURAN UI as well as population analysis research.

## 2021-10-04

Today I was reading papers about population neuroscience and techniques for analysis.

Humphries has an interesting paper arguing for more use of network neuro in neuroscience.
Also has a paper which was a population study on spike dynamics which I need to pay more attention to, to see if I could do something similar for the neuronal populations in newer recording sets.

So tomorrow I think I can start to put some of these ideas into practice and start coming up with ideas for next steps. Would be worth consulting my two books on this as well.

Other tutorial here on plotting in a GUI https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/plotting-matplotlib/.

Working with UI in the morning, code is in PrivateCode - will do more reading later to get a plan.

In the morning, reading to try and get a plan of this experiment.

In the afternoon, experimenting with the GUI that I am trying to make.
Need to revisit the idea about the LFP and replay.

A very good an in depth list of tutorials here on making a node editor using QT https://www.blenderfreak.com/tutorials/node-editor-tutorial-series/
This has lead to the python package nodeeditor, which I should look at.

Alternatively, I have figured out how to dynamically add to a dear pygui.
So a node editor might be possible

I'll list the requirements for a node editor here, and then can move them later:

1. Dynamically adding nodes either via another window or a popup menu.
2. Support custom nodes.
3. Set parameters on nodes and use these for computation.
4. Show plots on right click.
5. Show tooltips of variables.


Interesting application from Allen to predict what results will translate from mouse to human http://mouse2man.org/.

Need to convert SIMURAN logging to rich https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich

Check out what this can do for me, and the improvements over Rich https://github.com/FedeClaudi/pyinspect

Keep an eye on this for updates https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual

This could be good for new papers https://github.com/FedeClaudi/refy.

Good CLI to https://typer.tiangolo.com/.

Making good progress on a feature demonstrating small app!
Need to do research

Version 1.0 - detailed here https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/discussions/1283

Testing out wakatime to help time efforts.

## Friday, October 8, 2021

Interesting papers to look at from Mark Humphries - check them out later on!
These are in chapter 7.

Also looking again at trying to get a demo set up because the neuromatch academy is on again on Dec first with deadline for abstract the end of this month.

This looks interesting for documentation, I should keep an eye on it https://www.gitbook.com/?utm_source=content&utm_medium=trademark&utm_campaign=federicoclaudi.

I need to make a new repository for just regular tools I use! So for instance every monday I can open it, and I can run refy for papers.
It can even help me with time etc. Just need to place it all in one place. Will be a process over time though.
