# Week Roundups

## 2021 27

Started with this new method of journaling, still getting used to it, so not much content.
Recently got dog so not as productive as would like as dog was settling in.

## 2021 29

Bad journalling, but got some good coding work done this week.
Seems I forgot to journal last week, will be more consistent.

Just back from holidays in Clare (week 30). Good week this week, feel better after the break.
Lots of code progress for Beth LFP.

Start of the week, trying to build better habbits from "Atomic Habits" book.
Have been struggling with COVID (really the whole time), but especially recently.
Determined to fix.
