# 2022 week 14

SIMURAN work and starting on open data.

## Wednesday, April 6, 2022

Just finished up a few projects, so going to launch back into reading/writing and getting SIMURAN + last project done!

Need to check the citations to the dataset I am planning to use to see if someone has already done the same / similar thing with it.
Search for conferences that I could attend that have grants attached.

Check list of TODO here.

I might have an old list about of conferences that are related (maybe even in onenote)

Possible CSD method? https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009601
Probably too few wires in our case.
Anyway, code is here https://github.com/natalieklein/gpcsd/blob/main/neuropixels/fit_gpcsd2d.py

### Plan for today

https://pypi.org/project/pip-conflict-checker/
Better here https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree

Thought on SIMURAN - everything is going towards notebooks and examples - how to be useful in this space??

Allen visual behaviour multiscope has 4 depths in VISp and 4 depths in VISl, so perfect!
Along with this there is a task.
