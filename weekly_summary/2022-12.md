# 2022 week 12

Back to work after COVID.
Lots of planning and working on scope and objective of new tool.

## Monday, March 21, 2022

Starting back today after COVID. Planning to get straight into coding and writing.

Will look at conferences later on too.

* https://forum.fens.org/

Things to bring up and things to look at (will check TODO list here later on):

* Conferences and dissemination of research (grants?)
* Literature review possible from my thesis as a paper?
* What would go in a section of LFP and including Hams stuff?
* Make a more detailed plan for going forward from here.

I forgot that I had this https://gin.g-node.org/seankmartin/SIMURAN_Test_Data

Also note this dataset https://gin.g-node.org/NIN/V1_V4_1024_electrode_resting_state_data
from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359161666_1024-channel_electrophysiological_recordings_in_macaque_V1_and_V4_during_resting_state

And check this out better for working with the data https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
The paper actually lists a lot of other tools so it is very important
Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org/get-started/)

Also need to check this out for metadata http://g-node.github.io/python-odml/

Could I convert to snakemake or something like that at the end??

Trying to figure out how to make this actually useful at the moment.

Check in more detail the cognitive complexity of code from sonarsource (Cyclomatic complexity)

Spent the day working on getting some things set up for SIMURAN like testing coverage and the bug checking ideas.

Still need to read the snakemake paper and will look over better the notes from yesterday https://f1000research.com/articles/10-33/v2

### Plan for today

Time for about 4 pomodoros. So roughly four tasks.

1. Integrate changes from Shane into paper (latex too? - I think yes?).
2. Check upcoming conferences and make a list to show Shane.
3. Define the role of my software tool.
4. Check my literature review to see if it is distinct from what is already out there.
5. ER paper review.

Some of these will bleed into tomorrow, but I have task 1 done enough to show on Monday.

Moving old code out of SIMURAN and into neuro-tools

Was looking at snakemake and tutorial at end of day as well as SIMURAN project usage.
