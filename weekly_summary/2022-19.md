# 2022 week 19

## Monday, May 9, 2022

Last week I was working on getting my code to a reasonbaly stable place (it still needs many updates but I will do this in time.)

The software is in a much better place though - and hopefully I can clean it up a bit more from here!

Need to look at https://awkward-array.org/how-to-create-lists.html

In the morning I need to do a bit of practice on talking, and I also need to look at the thing that Shane sent on.
Further, I need to really get the code together in SIMURAN to work with old axona stuff too.
Also need to see what is wrong with the IBL download from the reproducibility paper.

Also need to create a new presentation roughly about what I do.
