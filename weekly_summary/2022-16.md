Back to work after the Easter weekend!

Have a look at this - they plan to open source all materials https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/2022-flatiron-machine-learning-x-science-summer-school/

The simon's foundation flatiron institute launched groups at the start of the year in [statistical](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/statistical-analysis-of-neural-data/) and [AI data analysis](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neuroai-and-geometry/)

Can use this for types on older python https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/

Considered the NMA course; problem, I think I know too much to be a student, and being a TA would take up too much of my time for what I can currently allow.
However, it did remind me that I wanted to brush up on some basic neuroscience surrounding brain regions, etc
I have two ebooks related to this that I want to go through and I also want to start up my brain explorer project.

This further reminds me that I need to set aside some time to go through my github repos and to also update my website.
Perhaps the best thing is to set aside a bit of time at night?
Anyway I need to review the daily plan that I currently have as it is not fully working out since COVID.

Need to do further work on the NWB https://www.nwb.org/.

I need to test the external hard drive that I brought home to see what is on it.
I also need to progress with my code review.

## Friday, April 22, 2022

1. Check contents of the drive I brought home.
2. Run the Allen for a single recording through new_main.

These last two can be for later on.
3. Write down some thoughts about model-free, comp-neuro, etc.
4. Start thinking about a tutorial for neural data analysis. (Big notebook in SIMURAN for e.g.)

Need to check the citations of the 2P visual dataset.

Check this out https://refactoring.guru/. I picked up the two books from here about refactoring and about design patterns.

NOTE This needs to come earlier.
Need to debug explore_ophys.py file - same as explore ephys - blocking me from downloading more data!
Maybe best is to check the manual download instructions.

Calcium imaging picks up more burst like events.

Really really useful to note:
NeuroDataReHack
Generate new insights from existing neurophysiology data through secondary analysis
October 3-5, 2022, Allen Institute, Seattle

Include some wirings in the thesis.

NWB has a youtube channel so I can check the vids that I missed https://www.youtube.com/c/NeurodataWithoutBorders/videos.
