## 2021 29

[[2021-29]]
Bad journalling, but got some good coding work done this week.
Seems I forgot to journal last week, will be more consistent.

## 2021 31

Just back from holidays in Clare (week 30). Good week this week, feel better after the break.
Lots of code progress for Beth LFP.

## 2021 32

Determined to fix.

Fixing final bits and bobs for Beth LFP paper.

## 2021 37

[[2021-37]]
Almost finished Beth's paper! Was checking how much code was written, and it is mad.
Basically written full time devs worth of code, while also doing other research things.
Meeting Shane next week Re work.

## 2021 38

[[2021-38]]
Was testing out automatic ICA for Beth's paper.
Didn't manage to get anything reliable, but very interesting algorithm.
I do have a very interesting failure case to put in my thesis though where there is a signal, and noise added to it.
The automatic ICA removes exactly the noise signal.
A good demo of ICA in general and should be in my thesis.

## 2021 39

[[2021-39]]
Dog spayed this week so a little slow.
However, final work on Beth's stuff and also coming to the hypothesis on correlation being "bad".

## 2021 40

[[2021-40]]
Feature demo for SIMURAN UI as well as population analysis research.

## 2021 41

[[2021-41]]
Finished the feature demo by the end of the week.

## 2021 42

[[2021-42]]
Was working on gathering together all the references and data sources for my last open data project.
Have many sources together and just getting ideas.
Also sent on the current (close to fin) version of the LFP paper to Shane.

## 2021 43
