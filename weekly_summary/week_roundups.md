# Week Roundups

## 2021 27

Started with this new method of journaling, still getting used to it, so not much content.
Recently got dog so not as productive as would like as dog was settling in.

## 2021 29

[[2021-29]]
Bad journalling, but got some good coding work done this week.
Seems I forgot to journal last week, will be more consistent.

## 2021 31

[[2021-31]]
Just back from holidays in Clare (week 30). Good week this week, feel better after the break.
Lots of code progress for Beth LFP.

## 2021 32

[[2021-32]]
Start of the week, trying to build better habbits from "Atomic Habits" book.
Have been struggling with COVID (really the whole time), but especially recently.
Determined to fix.

## 2021 33

[[2021-33]]
Friends no longer staying in apartment, I finished t-maze with Matheus and TCD course.

## 2021 34

[[2021-34]]
SFC in muscimol, LFP data gathering.

## 2021 35

[[2021-35]]
Conference on this week and running final bits for Beth LFP.

## 2021 36

[[2021-36]]
Fixing final bits and bobs for Beth LFP paper.

## 2021 37

[[2021-37]]
Almost finished Beth's paper! Was checking how much code was written, and it is mad.
Basically written full time devs worth of code, while also doing other research things.
Meeting Shane next week Re work.

## 2021 38

[[2021-38]]
Was testing out automatic ICA for Beth's paper.
Didn't manage to get anything reliable, but very interesting algorithm.
I do have a very interesting failure case to put in my thesis though where there is a signal, and noise added to it.
The automatic ICA removes exactly the noise signal.
A good demo of ICA in general and should be in my thesis.

## 2021 39

[[2021-39]]
Dog spayed this week so a little slow.
However, final work on Beth's stuff and also coming to the hypothesis on correlation being "bad".

## 2021 40

[[2021-40]]
Feature demo for SIMURAN UI as well as population analysis research.

## 2021 41

[[2021-41]]
Finished the feature demo by the end of the week.

## 2021 42

[[2021-42]]
Was working on gathering together all the references and data sources for my last open data project.
Have many sources together and just getting ideas.
Also sent on the current (close to fin) version of the LFP paper to Shane.

## 2021 43

[[2021-43]]
In progress! Should be project planning though.
Also Matheus leaving at end of week, so wrapping up some things.

## 2021 44

[[2021-44]]
Had a short break at the start of the week as was exhausted.
I started using the pomodoro timer this week, which seems to be pretty promising.
As for work, I got much more study done on my last topic, and starting to plan final bits for thesis.

## 2021 45

[[2021-45]]
Got thesis in shape to start writing into.
Investigated more open data sets.
Used https://connectivity.brain-map.org/3d-viewer to consider how to upgrade the connections paper.

[[2021-46]]
Work on the connectivity paper.

## 2021 47

[[2021-47]]
Much more info on DANDI, and need to integrate this style into my software.
Have some videos for reference that I made at the time.
Finally, good work on the 3D vis for connectivity paper.

## 2021 48

[[2021-48]]
Mostly thesis writing and neuromatch academy.
I approached Nmatch very differently this year, and really only tuned in for what I was very interested in - and it went much much better.
I think I have finally identified the kind of work that I find exciting.

I need to make somewhere to track the consecutive number of days that I have done writing for!
