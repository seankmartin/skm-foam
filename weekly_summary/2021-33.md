# 2021 week 33

Friends no longer staying in apartment, I finished t-maze with Matheus and TCD course.

## Wednesday, August 18, 2021

Friends have gone home so can finally get back to work properly.

### Priorities

1. Fix not found in Matheus t-maze sheet.
2. Plot the t-maze data.
3. Reply to Shane and check G scholar alerts.
4. Decide what to do with the muscimol data. At the very least should do theta power. Perhaps also spike LFP.
5. Make a list of the plots that will be in the paper and the functions used to generate them.
6. Update Beth paper.
7. More copyright on blackboard.

### Achieved

Got a lot of the t-maze fixing done, took a long time though.
Replied to Shane re conferences and applied for them.

## Thursday, August 19, 2021

Priorities remain the same as yesterday.

### Achieved

1. Finished the list of t-maze times with Matheus.
