# 2022 week 21

Doing great at the moment.
This week was mostly focused on coding.
I have greatly simplified and refined the interface of SIMURAN and its purpose (though it still needs more work)
And am integrating that with Snakemake to rerun the analysis for the ATNx LFP in a much more reproducibile manner.

Tomorrow need to upload data and compare interactive_plot to fixed plot and run more data.
Also check about registering data to a [snakemake report](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/reporting.html).

COSYNE has a lot of information about the last meeting they had online, should check it out here https://www.cosyne.org/.
Also need to look tomorrow at making some weekly summaries and incorporating some recent information into my TODO list.
Finally, I need to check how my time is lining up currently with the plan I made a few months ago, and update the plan if needed.

Lastly, I should update my article about pynwb to include accessing the data and adding custom tables to the data, as well as the nwb-widgets package.
