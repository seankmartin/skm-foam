# 2021 week 37

Almost finished Beth's paper! Was checking how much code was written, and it is mad.
Basically written full time devs worth of code, while also doing other research things.
Meeting Shane next week Re work.

## Wednesday, September 15, 2021

Was unwell, very frustrating. Back to work.

### Achieved

Lots of stats done - nearly there!

## Thursday, September 16, 2021

Got lots of stats done and worked about 5 hours.

## Friday, September 17, 2021

### Notes

1. May have to remove the phase tests as these are not using circular statistics.

I'm going through the code for Beth's work for a final run through. Will note any issues here and fix.
I will only look at the analysis as the mappings are fine, have been checked many times.
Seems fine!
