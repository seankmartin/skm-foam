Working on thesis, NMC, and connections.

Picked out a few interesting things from NMC, but note that the flash talks seem to be viewable at any time.

For the connections paper, I finished intersecting the probes with cells, and completed the visualization of the whole thing.
Some results from this vis are in my thesis figures folder under my PhD folder.

Idea for a little project - take the paper recommender from Claudio and make it voice based.

In the morning, gathering everything together for Shane.
In the afternoon, think I will get my literature review together for this project.
