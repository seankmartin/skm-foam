# 2021 week 43

In progress! Should be project planning though.
Also Matheus leaving at end of week, so wrapping up some things.


## Tuesday, October 26, 2021

Back to work after the long weekend cleaning.

Note that Richard Gao wrote a lot of relateable stuff for the PhD that could be interesting to look at.

Today in the morning I was in the office, and it seems my computer is back working.

Matheus also sent me on a paper that uses open data from the Buzsaki lab which could be good to look at soon.

### Matheus leaving

Matheus might need help to get the ripples finished, will take note of those here:
(For me) - Matheus leaving - mostly help with ripples.
1. Send me on the where you are with the ripples - I can help you finish that.
2. Exercise/diet study - data shared through Drive.
3. Inventory of the lab for expensive equipment.

Matheus and I will come in on Friday morning to do lab inventory and anything else that is needed.
