Working on connections today.

I just want to make some notes here on the size of the probes.
So Steinmetz 2018 challenges lists some sizes of probes etc. which is very good.
Then Buccino 2019 asked an interesting question about whether the probes influence the underlying structure, and modelled within 100microns at most.
Buccino 2018 asked an interesting way to localise and classify neurons from their action potentials and placed cells about 80microns out with some extra movement above the probe or to the side of the probe (so overall about 100microns max).

I should move on to Python 3.10 for my new project.
Also need to push to brainrender (probably today).
