# 2021 week 46

Work on the connectivity paper.

## Tuesday, November 16, 2021

Was unwell yesterday with my ears, and spent today getting them fixed.
Feel quite unwell and off balance though, doc said that should pass soon.

For tomorrow morning, I need to do the following:

1. Last read through open data and send it on.
2. Last read through summary and send it on.
3. Read / finish reading the paper on connectivity.
4. Watch the video from Allen institute on the new section. (neural something)

### Allen institute for brain dynamics

Set up on November 11 2021 and lead by Karel Svoboda.
Split into:

1. Electrophysiology
2. Multiscale molecular anatomy
3. Optical Physiology
4. Instrumentation

Introductory talk here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVD1QkPCRBA

Mission - How does our brain build understanding of the complex world around us to guide the flexible behaviours that address our biological needs.
Defined neuron types interacting across the whole brain and body.
Slide in the talk that shows the allen mouse projections in a nice fashion.

Very interesting thought to record neurons (AND their types simultaneously)
How are signals propagated through neural circuits.

Some ideas in my rocketbook for continuing. I'll note them down here elsewhere.
Note the brainrender examples.

Going to work on thesis writing for a bit and then back to the connectivity paper.
