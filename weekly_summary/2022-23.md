# 2022 week 23

Finished bulk of NWB conversion and have an article [here](https://seankmartin.netlify.app/neuroscience/pynwb/).
Also recreated many of the analysis results using snakemake

## Thursday, June 9, 2022

Seems that I may not be able to use copies of NWBfiles due to this issue:
https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/1223

Trying instead to directly append to the data. This works, though perhaps is not the preference.

Ok, have a good chunk of the snakemake working.
Need to update this tomorrow so that all the old functionality is there.
And then I can work to clean up the files.
