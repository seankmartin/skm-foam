Start of the week, trying to build better habbits from "Atomic Habits" book.
Have been struggling with COVID (really the whole time), but especially recently.
Determined to fix.

## Tuesday, August 10, 2021

### Plan
Coding

### Achieved

Got the shuffling working for the STA and SFC.
Also improved my journalling a lot.
Finally, got a handle of the papers I had lost reference to for the paper.

### Plan

- Fix how slow the shuffling of spikes is in STA and SFC.
- Continue to get through list for Beth LFP

### Achieved

- Fixed the shuffling. Still slow, but a bit more manageable. Further improvements?
- Listed out the muscimol recordings, will start to test running them. First list the files to make sure not missing anything.
- Performed all of the ATNx CA1 theta analysis. Looks fine but might need a summary plot. My SIMURAN code works well with a mounted online system.

The last two days friends have been staying from Switzerland, so work is a little bit out of whack. As such I've not been able to do any coding. I have been doing some reading though when I can.
I have some thoughts from this reading that I need to summarise, and some new papers to look at based on it. When friends are gone, will finish off the code for Beth's paper.
