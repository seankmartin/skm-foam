# 2022 week 24

Working on planning and coding.


## Monday, June 13, 2022

Need to refocus and adjust plans based on recent changes.

So today, I want to:

### Re-evaluate plans, taking information from

1. Physical notebooks
2. This repository
3. My thesis
4. Old notes on drive

I will store this information in a new section of this repository, called planning, and can include some images from inkscape etc. to help with this.

### Coding

Continue with the code for the snakemake repository to be able to generate all the old results that we had.
Unfortunately need to redo this because the old code was too messy.

### Writing thesis

I need to get back into the habit of writing my thesis every day, I think I will aim to do this in the evening today.

### Set up a daily section

At the moment, there are some daily data uploading and downloading scripts that I need to run at the start of each day, I need to set these up.

### Create a new landing page for this project

Just update the popular links and restructure the landing page a little bit to improve it.

### Achieved

- none
