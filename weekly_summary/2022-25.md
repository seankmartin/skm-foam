## Wednesday, June, 2022

A little bit of time off last few days.

### Plan

- Start with T-maze conversion and analysis for the LFP experiment.
- Check spike LFP output.
- Writing thesis to get back into it.
- Possibly sleep analysis for LFP.
- Hypothesis tests.

### Achieved

- Something broke with the OSF upload, I have a folder with all the data that needs to be uploaded.
- I can ask OSF if something broke, or alternatively I can zip these folders and upload as single files to OSF.
- Nearly have the muscimol conversion working for the CanCSCa1 group and the SUB RSC group - one or two things here, need to inspect the output in HDFview and make sure electrodes in correct brain regions. Also I need to check and see if the process_lfp should use the regular pick or new pick. I think the new pick should only be for CanCSCaR animals - so probably need to change to reflect that in both the process and the convert - NB for tomorrow.
