# 2021 week 29

Bad journalling, but got some good coding work done this week.
Seems I forgot to journal last week, will be more consistent.

### Current doing

1. NeuroChaT is running away, when done, save the results and then get all the graphics files.
2. Fix the decoding

### Next up

1. Go through papers and fix + add to analyses (e.g. shuffling for spike-lfp)

### Notes

The chance performance of the decoder was determined by shuffling the trial labels of the training set before the cross-validation procedure. - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6605161/
Now in our case, the chance performance should be 50% as is just binary.

The control consisted in repeating the same procedure using randomly shuffled spikes, in which the same number of spikes was distributed randomly across the time axis. This control eliminates spurious estimates attributable to poor statistics or artifacts.

Learnt a lot about logging! The root logger is always used. See SIMURAN and py_utils for a possible way to set up different loggers.
This is likely a good start, could probably use some better classes though.

There is an interesting point from this paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34283328/ about artifact detection in LFP.
Note though that it can't currently replace artifacts, currently it can just use ML to detect them.
The best performed seemed to be using a CNN.
