# Beth LFP Meetings

## 7 July 2021
Going to meet Matheus and Beth about the data before meeting up with Shane and John potentially tomorrow.

### Any difference between 1 - 3 CTRL/L and 4+
No experimental difference. The first set of rats were probably kept a little bit longer, so maybe had some less drive, but no inherent difference.
### Recordings with not all EEG files
These are still all the same channels (even if not all numbers are there). Perhaps they were grounded sometimes.

### Any analysis you would like to see or things noticed
Not really, seems had looked at the first three panels already.

### Should we include CRS in openfield or just CSR
Depends on what you are looking for. If you want a steady set where the wires are in the same place, then it would be best to consider the openfield recordings.

### How confident are we in the recording mappings
Yes we have them right!

### Muscimol data layout
So the files that "muscimol" in it, have muscimol applied. The others are just regular style recordings in cannulated animals.
