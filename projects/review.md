# Literature review

Does my review already exist in the literature?
Search term: Neural population, neuronal interactions, neural dimension reduction, large scale recordings
Note, read Semedo thesis review section.

## Notes on mine

Layout: Story intro,
Background on recordings (not much needed if paper)
Still not convinced how clean my encoding decoding explanation is - check Cunningham for e.g.

## Places

- Current opinion in neurobiology.

## New papers

1. [Population models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438821000726)

## Urai ea, Churchland lab - Large scale recordings require new approach - 2021

Describes emerging tools and interpretation.
Only covers neurons.
The intro actually mimics the correlation discussion in a later chapter of thesis.
TODO read the section on insights again in more detail.

## Saxena, Cunningham - Towards the neural population doctrine - 2019

Four areas where analysis of neural populations correlated variability, decoding, neural dynamics, ANNs.
Hardware and computational techniques well reviewed (Cunningham 2018 and 2014 Dimensionality reduction and neural data science).

## Semedo ea., Kohn Yu labs - Stats methods for dissecting interactions between brain areas - 2020

Dimensionality reduction, GLMs, gLARA, DLAG, DCCA, etc.
Pretty familiar with most of this but should double check.

## Humphries - Strong and weak principles of neural dimension reduction - 2021

Commentary on neural dimension reduction.

## da Silveira and Rieke - The geometry of information coding in correlated neural populations - 2021

Noise correlations impact on the neural code. NOTE very important for a later chapter in thesis.

## Vyas et al - Computation through neural population dynamics - 2021
