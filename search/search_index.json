For a minor chord it is 3, 4.</p> <p>The best way to build up chords is using the scale for that chord. However, let us consider it relative to the major scale for now. Remeber that scales are labelled (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...) For major chords, it is just the 1, 3, and 5. For 7th chords, it is assumed (unless stated otherwise, as in Cmaj7) that the 7th is flat. So Cmaj7 is C E G B C7 is C E G Bb (this is also called dominant due to its sound) Cm7 is C Eb G Bb</p> <p>To build up further chords, just follow the scale! It is assumed that you play the notes in between (e.g. C11 would have the 7th and 9th played as well). I've never seen any higher than C13</p> <p>This brings up an interesting way to play chords, by playing the notes from these large chords in any kind of inversion! E.g to play Dmin11 (D F G C E G) (let us label octaves by 1...) Play D1, F2, G2, C3, E3, G3 so that would be like playing C major over D minor.</p> <p>Further to inversions, the notes can be played anywhere! As long as you have the notes. So you have the chord tones and the scale. You can restructure your chords so that you are not really moving the hand around. This also leads to really nice voicings.</p>"},{"location":"hobbies/piano/#voicings","title":"Voicings","text":"<p>You can play an entire scale as a voicing. A voicing in general is a bunch of notes from a scale. The upper extensions are the things added to the chord outside of the original. He plays a sharp 11 with the Cmaj7 because of the lydian scale. So you can just stack thirds on top of eachother - then you end up playing the whole scale but in two octaves.</p> <p>A really interesting thing to do is to move the chord progression down by using voicings! E.g. Fminor7 with dorian scale Bb Mixolydian (but allowing many things) Eb Lydian (this is a 2 5 1 in Eb) You don't have to think in scales for this though, just think of a chromatic movement of the chord. As such, the motions are as simple as possible.</p> <p>An example of the 2 5 1 6 in Eb Play Fmin7 Bb7 Ebmaj7 C7, then make easier with Fmin7, Bb7 (2nd inversion) Ebmaj7 C7 (1st inversion) Remember that the C7 and Bb7 are dominant chords (so they want to resolve to the 1 and 2 respectively) Note that they chromatically are moving by the same amount.</p> <p>The same voicing works on the five chord as well as a tritone (three whole steps) substition. You can roll a tenth!</p> <p>For moving around, you could move chromatically, in whole steps, around the circle of fifths. etc.</p> <p>To follow up on voicings, the most important part of chords are the 3rd and the 7th.

To identify chord progressions, what you'll be listening for are two things, primarily. First, you need to identify root motion as an indicator of likely chord progression. Often, you can listen for the bass, as the bass quite commonly plays the root of a chord, especially in a lot of pop music and such. However, this is sometimes tricky because there's no rule that says the lowest note you're hearing has to be the root of the chord. Sometimes, we can play a chord but put that chord's 3rd on the bottom. To help in those situations, you'll then want to apply your knowledge of functional harmony. i.e. \"What is the most likely chord to use in this particular scenario based on the context directly surrounding it?\" In addition to root motion, you'll also need to know the quality of the chords. Are they minor? Major? Dominant? etc.</p> <p>If this initially sounds like a lot, that's ok! The place to start is with ear training and identifying intervals. This is what will help you learn melodies, also. Being able to hear 2 notes and know that they are, for example, a 4th apart is essential in being able to identify chord qualities, root motions, melodies, etc. We'll have entire courses to help you with this, but basically you're familiarizing your ear with the sound of different intervals so that you can recognize them easily no matter what component of the song you're listening for. Ear training will also help with quickly identifying chord qualities. In a split second, you'll hear when something is minor, major, whether the 7th is minor or major, what the upper extensions are, etc. All of these things help to give more context to the overall harmony and will help you fill in the blanks.</p> <p>The more you do this, the more you'll see recurring patterns and you'll be able to recognize things almost as they're happening! It's how musicians can almost play along with songs they've never heard.</p>"},{"location":"hobbies/piano/#improv","title":"Improv","text":"<ol> <li>Listen back and take bits out that I liked, and then write these out.</li> <li>Try and keep a steady rhythm even though going on the fly.</li> <li>Better pedal work so as not to leave a gap between transititions.</li> <li>My feel of the music seems to be good.</li> <li>Try not to play the same chords quite as often.</li> <li>Tone, where are the highs and lows - build into tone shifts.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/dog-owning/","title":"Dog Owning","text":""},{"location":"life/dog-owning/#daily-routine","title":"Daily routine","text":"<p>Make sure to spray the balcony and show it to the dog every day to try and get them to pee there.</p>"},{"location":"life/dog-owning/#crate-training","title":"Crate training","text":"<ul> <li>Don't let them get out of the routine of being crate trained for sleeping.</li> <li>Don't punish them in the crate, since that is where we want them to sleep.</li> <li>Try to put their food near their crate so that they like the crate.</li> <li>Start to leave them in the crate for short amounts of time so that they will get used to that.</li> <li>Leave the door to the crate open so that they will go in and out of it as they please.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"life/driving/","title":"Driving","text":""},{"location":"life/driving/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ol> <li>https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/road-users/car-drivers</li> <li>https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/services/s3.2-adi/making-your-mark-marking-guidelines-for-the-driving-test.pdf?sfvrsn=548e1e7d_7</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/driving/#cockpit-check","title":"Cockpit check","text":"<ol> <li>Seat adjustments</li> <li>Mirror adjustments (side mirrors should see just the very side of your vehicle, and the rear view should see behind you well)</li> <li>Steering wheel adjustments</li> <li>Tug on seatbelt at top and bottom</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/driving/#taking-off","title":"Taking off","text":"<p>GOSHO:</p> <ol> <li>Gears - Put yourself in first gear after pressing in the clutch.</li> <li>Observation - six point observation (left, left mirror, front, front mirror, right mirror, right).</li> <li>Signal - indicate to turn out.</li> <li>Handbrake - Release the handbrake.</li> <li>Observation - points 5 and 6, so right hand mirrors.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/driving/#turning","title":"Turning","text":"<ol> <li>Observe</li> <li>Signal</li> <li>Observe</li> <li>Move (Postion and speed)</li> <li>Look ahead</li> <li>Turn</li> </ol>"},{"location":"life/driving/#junctions","title":"Junctions","text":"<p>If you can't see on both sides of a junction, you must stop.

I think this is a big one for me, a clear space is a clear mind for instance. Overall it is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues. An important one here is digital spaces.

So far nothing really new to me, but however it is important to re-emphasise how many spikes are needed to make just one spike - and the inhibition excitation balance (inhibition is stronger but less of them).</p> <p>Cells also (at least in VC) tend to be connected to other cells that respond to the same thing more regularly. This is because lots of cells would need to send this signal of hey I see and edge for it to create a new spike elsewhere.</p> <p>So with place cells, they must be an ensemble of similar responding place cells that send the information to somewhere downstream. But where is the downstream, and what does it do with it? And if we recorded lots of cells, could we detect the ensemble and the downstream? Further there should really be downstreams.</p> <p>So the way this must work is that ensembles really are the unit of computation not single cells. But what about those cells that respond alone? I think are some examples of hugely influential single cells (retinal ganglion?). Then these ensembles interact.</p> <p>So you could have a bunch of ensembles that shouldn't interact for distinct sense/ideas, which then interact with other ensembles to send information (as a single spike would just get lost in the void.)</p> <p>This would suggest that the analysis I should really be focusing on is either PCA (assuming a dim is an ensemble) or some form of ensemble detection + interacting (e.g. info theory) on these ensembles. It would want to be pretty automatic as well.

However, there is much discussion on this, so it is a large topic (which is both good and bad). The most discussion is around correlation, information, redundancy, probability (Bayesian and frequentist), and a bit of decoding.</p> <p>This could actually be very important Different population dynamics in the supplementary motor area and motor cortex during reaching</p> <ul> <li>They show that on a single neuron level, the responses from supplementary motor area and motor cortex are similar but on a population level they appear to be performing different functions.</li> <li>Remember the proposed relationship (by me, but seems pretty clear) - that correlation increase, decreases the dimensionality of the neural representation. As such papers that discuss dimensionality and task performance also investigate the same thing, such as The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks | Nature. Note that this paper has an absolutely massive suplemental material associated with it.</li> </ul> <p>Note on the topic of correlations, Correlations and Neuronal Population Information | Annual Review of Neuroscience has a good description of the different correlations usually used in neuroscience. \"Work in the past few decades has greatly advanced our understanding of how neuronal popu- lation information is influenced by correlations. Theoretical work has been instrumental in this progress. It has shown us that some forms of correlations limit information, whereas others do not. At least in the context of population information, theoretical progress has also revealed that simply characterizing response statistics can have limited value: Describing correlations does not translate into understanding information, as the largest correlations do not necessarily have the strongest effect on information. We view this progress as a cautionary tale because we are entering an era when our power to measure brain activity is exploding, while our conceptual frameworks remain underdeveloped. Our situation is perhaps analogous to pre-Newtonian physics, which attempted to understand the movements of the stars and planets through extremely careful and detailed measurements. Ultimately, however, orbits were understood in a straightforward way with Newtonian physics. We see a risk that we\u2014like pre-Newtonian physicists, but abetted by much more powerful instrumentation\u2014will drown in a sea of description, measuring and char- acterizing population activity patterns rather than understanding the computations and functions they underlie.\"</p> <p>Papers:</p> <ul> <li>Information-limiting correlations | Nature Neuroscience</li> <li>Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance | Nature</li> <li>Redundancy reduction revisited</li> <li>Neural correlations, population coding and computation | Nature Reviews Neuroscience</li> <li>Correlations enhance the behavioral readout of neural population activity in association cortex | Nature Neuroscience</li> <li>Good decisions require more than information | Nature Neuroscience</li> <li>Correlations and Neuronal Population Information | Annual Review of Neuroscience</li> <li>Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior</li> </ul>"},{"location":"phd/projects/open-data/#population-dynamics-are-similar-between-brain-regions-as-long-as-they-have-reasonably-similar-stuctural-connectivity","title":"Population dynamics are similar between brain regions as long as they have reasonably similar stuctural connectivity.","text":"<p>Essentially, this would be claiming that neural activity really is dominated by structural activity.

While previous investigations of inter-regional communication were primarily performed via neuroimaging and electroencephalography, these are of limited spatial and temporal resolution. Recent technological advances and improved recording techniques have opened new avenues in cross-region intracranial recordings, allowing us to explore the interactions between brain regions at a finer scale than ever before. This thesis addresses the analysis of inter-regional interactions using a variety of data types obtained from simultaneous recordings of brain activity.</p> <p>To facilitate this analysis, we introduce Simuran, a software tool that enables the analysis of different data formats and promotes interoperability between neural data and analysis tools. Using Simuran, we investigate the impact of anterior thalamic lesion or inactivation in rats on the hippocampus, subiculum, and retrosplenial cortex. Our results reveal that anterior thalamic lesions disrupt spatial cell coding in the subiculum while leaving CA1 spatial cell coding intact. Interestingly, at the local field potential level, the effect of these lesions is not clear in the subiculum alone; rather, differences emerge when comparing local field potentials across brain regions and examining the relationship between local field potentials and spiking activity.</p> <p>Next, we explore interactions at the neuron-level and consider the likelihood of recording structurally connected neurons across regions using simulations and statistics. Our findings indicate that modern recording techniques offer a high probability of capturing synaptically connected neurons across well-connected brain areas. Leveraging this connection probability, we turn to analysing large-scale datasets. The results suggest that task performance involves a balance between consistency in the represented information via highly correlated neural activity, while avoiding excessive redundancy.

However, the availability and continued development of numerous software tools and data formats have presented a challenge for neuroscientists analysing this type of data. To address this challenge, we developed Simuran, a Python library that simplifies the process of analysing large neural data recordings and facilitates interfacing with other analysis software. Simuran supports a variety of data formats and sources, including Axona, NWB, the Allen Institute, and the International Brain Laboratory, in addition to neuroscience analysis libraries such as NeuroChaT, MNE, Elephant, and Neo. Simuran also provides a node-based user interface to streamline the analysis process for inexperienced coders. We have successfully used Simuran to analyse data from multiple brain regions simultaneously, including handling large experiments and analysing open-source datasets. Simuran is used to convert Axona experiments to common format and analyse spiking activity and local field potentials from the subiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and CA1. We also demonstrate using Simuran to analyse data from the Allen Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.</p> <p>In summary, we have developed a flexible tool that enables the analysis of neural data from multiple brain regions simultaneously.

We focused on the role of the anterior thalamic nuclei for spatial coding in the subiculum and CA1. By understanding the role of the ATN in this circuit, we aimed to shed light on the mechanisms underlying spatial coding and implications for memory and amnesia. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in freely moving male rats with permanent ATN lesions or temporary inhibition of the ATN to obtain single-unit measurements. Recordings of units were obtained from the dorsal subiculum and CA1 of lesioned rats, and the dorsal subiculum of control rats. Control and lesioned rats were tested in behavioural tasks, including spatial alternation tasks and open-field exploration. Our findings revealed that both permanent and reversible lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei led to a complete cessation of subicular spatial signalling. As a result, spatial memory performance was reduced to chance levels. Interestingly, place cells in the hippocampal CA1 region remained largely unaffected by the lesions. From our results, we can conclude that the outputs from CA1 alone are insufficient for subicular spatial coding. Instead, the anterior thalamic nuclei play a critical role in providing key inputs or modulating the subiculum to support spatial coding. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying spatial coding and memory formation in the limbic system.</p>"},{"location":"phd/viva/abstracts/#chapter-5---lfp-with-anterior-thalamic-lesions","title":"Chapter 5 - LFP with anterior thalamic lesions","text":"<p>The ATN are vital for spatial memory in rodents and appear necessary for episodic memory in humans. We previously showed how ATN lesions abrogate spatial coding in subicular cells. Here, we further elucidate these findings by investigating the relationship between the LFP and single-unit activity in the dorsal subiculum and the LFP in ipsilateral RSC post-lesion of the ATN. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in rats during free-exploration and spatial alternation tasks with permanent ATN lesions via NMDA and temporary ATN inhibition via muscimol to obtain single-unit measurements and LFPs. We primarily focused on analysing theta rhythm activity (related to spatial coding in single units), beta rhythm activity (linked to learning and novelty detection), and sharp-wave ripples during sleep (linked to memory and replay) from LFPs. Lesion effects on subicular LFPs were unexpectedly subtle, given the gross behavioural impairments present post-lesion. Theta and beta rhythms, sharp-wave ripples during sleep, and the relationship between motor activity and theta rhythm activity were all maintained in the subiculum post-lesion. However, power in RSC LFPs was reduced outside of the theta band post-lesion, the coherence between LFPs from RSC and subiculum was reduced in T-maze trials post-lesion (but less so in open-field exploration), and the coupling between the subicular LFP theta phase and single unit-spiking activity was reduced post-lesion. We suggest that a key contributor to the behavioural impairments post-lesion may stem from a change in the transfer or representation of information between regions in the hippocampal circuit following anterior thalamic impairment.</p>"},{"location":"phd/viva/abstracts/#chapter-6---neuron-connectivity","title":"Chapter 6 - neuron connectivity","text":"<p>Large-scale simultaneous in vivo recordings of neurons in multiple brain regions prompt the question of whether we can capture direct interactions between these neurons. This, in turn, opens the possibility of identifying inter-regional communication rules during behavioural tasks, assuming we can detect coordinated activity among neurons in connected brain regions. Here, we take a first step towards addressing this issue by estimating the number of connected neurons that can be recorded through simultaneous recordings in anatomically connected brain regions. To investigate this, we construct a directed acyclic graph that represents the chemical synapses between neurons in the specific brain regions under study. Through Monte Carlo simulations and statistical analyses, we develop a method for calculating the probability distribution of recordable neurons that are connected. We apply this method to neurons in the neocortex, following the Blue Brain model of the mouse neocortex connectome, as well as to neurons in the hippocampus and subiculum, based on statistical data from anatomical studies. Our findings reveal that the probability of recording a connected pair of neurons is notably high in well-connected brain regions like the hippocampus and subiculum. In the neocortex, the probability is relatively lower but still significant. Furthermore, along chains of synapses, such as disynaptic or trisynaptic connections, the probability of recording connected neurons increases dramatically. By employing high-throughput neural recording technologies in well-connected brain areas, such as specific regions within the auditory cortex, we can enhance the likelihood of capturing a substantial number of neuron pairs that are directly connected across brain regions. Consequently, these techniques hold promise for investigating and validating hypotheses related to interregional communication and source transformation rules.</p>"},{"location":"phd/viva/abstracts/#chapter-7---task-perfomance-and-correlations","title":"Chapter 7 - task perfomance and correlations","text":"<p>The relationship between the timing of action potentials from multiple neurons with stimuli and observed behaviours has been a long-standing topic of interest. From a theoretical view, increased neural correlation implies reduced information transmission. Despite this, evidence suggests that increased neural correlation could enhance task performance. This suggests a delicate balance between neural information efficiency and stability, with task performance potentially influencing this balance. In this study, we investigate this relationship and its dependence on task performance. We compare coherence from local field potentials in the claustrum, anterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex across fixed interval and fixed ratio tasks. We then compare correlations between a reduced dimension representation of neural firing in catch and miss trials during a visual change detection task. To identify these low-dimensional representations of neural firing, we employ canonical correlation analysis. Additionally, we use Gaussian process factor analysis to generate latent neural trajectories in visual and limbic system brain areas, allowing us to assess the similarity of computations between catch and miss trials in the same visual change detection task. Coherence differed in a region-specific manner between fixed interval and fixed ratio trials. Latent neural trajectories were distinctly separable between catch and miss trials. However, the shape of the neural trajectories often appeared similar for catch and miss trials, suggesting that related computations were being performed. The correlation between the reduced dimensional activity differed between catch and miss trials, with higher correlation in catch trials for visual areas and lower correlation in catch trials for limbic system areas. Our findings demonstrate that trial-to-trial correlations vary across similar tasks and task performance, but in a region-specific manner. Thus, the correlation-task relationship appears to be highly task- and brain region-dependent, lacking a general rule. These results offer insights that can help explain the conflicting reports on the correlation-task relationship.</p>"},{"location":"phd/viva/notes/","title":"Notes","text":""},{"location":"phd/viva/notes/#phd","title":"PhD","text":"<ul> <li>Quite excited about expansion microscopy, and the possibility of using it to study the brain.</li> <li>Mouse brain has about 85 million neurons, and billions to trillions of synapses.
