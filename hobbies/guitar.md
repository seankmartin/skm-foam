## The strings
E A D G B E (eat all day get big easy)
This is the standard tuning (from low to high)
By holding down a fret, you lower the note by a single semitone.
As such, you can test the tuning of a guitar by holding down the fifth fret (fourth from G to B)
If the notes sound similar, then it is well tuned!

A capo then just lowers all the notes by X semitones.
