# Knife sharpening

1. Soak the stone block until bubbles stop forming
2. Wet the surface of the stone and keep the surface wet throughout the process
3. Begin on the coarse side of the stone and move to the fine side.
4. Get the angle right on the knife bevel and sharpen up and down the stone. Do this on each side of the knife.
5. On the fine side, do two passes, one coarse and then a soft pressure pass.
6. Test the sharpness by cutting a piece of paper. If it cuts easily, it is sharp.
7. Coat the rough leather with a polishing compound and strop the knife on the leather. Smooth by only going in one direction and don't cut the leather.
8. Test the sharpness again.

You can draw a marker line on the knife to see if you are sharpening the whole blade.
