10 most common scales (the 7 modes, )

## Writing methods

- Vertical writing is doing it as a measure. Each instrument can end up then getting a boring piece.
- However, horizontal writing you write each piece individually for each instrument. Thad Jones wrote like this. In this way, every instrument might have its own melody.

From the horizontal writing you end up with interesting voices "kids are pretty people" by thad jones (village vanguard orchestra)
For piano we want to achieve more of this style!
