## Chords

For a major chord, there are 4, then 3 half steps from the root. For a minor chord it is 3, 4.

The best way to build up chords is using the scale for that chord.
However, let us consider it relative to the major scale for now.
Remeber that scales are labelled (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...)
For major chords, it is just the 1, 3, and 5.
For 7th chords, it is assumed (unless stated otherwise, as in Cmaj7) that the 7th is flat.
So Cmaj7 is **C E G B**
C7 is **C E G Bb** (this is also called dominant due to its sound)
Cm7 is **C Eb G Bb**

To build up further chords, just follow the scale! It is assumed that you play the notes in between (e.g. C11 would have the 7th and 9th played as well).
I've never seen any higher than C13

This brings up an interesting way to play chords, by playing the notes from these large chords in any kind of inversion!
E.g to play Dmin11 (**D F G C E G**) (let us label octaves by 1...)
Play **D1, F2, G2, C3, E3, G3** so that would be like playing C major over D minor.

## Scales

The formula for a major scale is ROOT, W W H W W W H (think of C here)
The formula for a minor scale is ROOT, W H W W H W W (think of A here)

The pentatonic scale is made of five notes only - think of the black keys!
For C major, leave out the F and B

## Modes

A mode is a modification to the major scale. For example, for C major scale (all white keys), you could start the scale on any other key.
Doing so loads to modes. For instance, start C major on D leads to two ideas for the same thing:
The second mode of C major, and D dorian.
So modes of one scale, lead to new scales for different notes.

### Ionian mode

The "regular" mode is the ionian mode. This is just the major scale.
It can accompany major chords. But maybe not that commonly (at least in jazz).

### Dorian mode

Flat 3 and flat 7 gives a dorian.
Think of the second mode of C major for this one!
This is the go to option over a minor 7th chord.
It contains all of the chord tones and fills the rest in very nicely.
A minor is seen very commonly as the 2 in a 2 5 1.

### All modes with steps

C Ionian (major) â€” CDEFGABC
(intervals: Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half)

D Dorian â€” DEFGABCD
(intervals: Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole)

E Phrygian â€” EFGABCDE
(intervals: Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole)

F Lydian â€” FGABCDEF
(intervals: Whole - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Half)

G Mixolydian â€” GABCDEFG
(intervals: Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole)

A Aeolian (minor) â€” ABCDEFGA
(intervals: Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole)

B Locrian â€” BCDEFGAB
(intervals: Half - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole)

## Common chord progressions

2 5 1 (jazzy / poppy)
1 5 6 4 (very poppy)
