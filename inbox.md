## Thoughts

We can't consider single neurons because the probes are blind and we can't have any way to know if they are connected.
We could guess correlations / causal interactions - but these would not indicate much.
If we used calcium imaging then concerns remain like the sampling rate (e.g. papers that check how similar CI is to spikes.
Further, even if we think of trying to match up CI with a connectome - the connections are dynamic?
Plus, is CI high enough resolution to identify cell types??
Maybe only in post

As such, the option to avoid working with fMRI is to consider neurons as an ensemble.
Perhaps information theory is the real kicker.

## Questions

1. Can cell types be detected in CI?
2. What is the link between CI and spikes (ephys) - there is a paper on this?
3. What of connectomes and plasticity?
