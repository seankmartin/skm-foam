# Life

## Cycles

We tend to work in cycles and with rhythms.
We have the circadian cycle, which helps us to sleep. Keep these cycles and tips for managing it in mind.

1. The circadian cycle is best set by sunlight. So head outside in the morning and the evening before sunset. Then, try to keep the lights in your environment low. 
2. We sleep in 90 minute cycles. So if aiming to wake at 7:30 the best sleep times would be 10:30, 12:00, and 1:30.
3. We are most ready for exercise when our body is warm. Our body has a natural temperature fluctuation. Some possible times would be 30 min after waking for exercise, then around lunch, and then in the evening.

## Meditation

Good resources are guided yoga nidra. Yoga itself can be good too.

## Study practices

These are great for concentration:

- Classical music
- Study with me videos

## Video games

Make downtime for video games, don't just ignore them as too difficult to fit into schedule.
Further, try to consider life as a game.

Think of what makes a game satisfying.
E.g.

- Clear progress and visualisation of progress.
- Tailored challenges.
- Changing environments.
- Frequent rewards that make the character stronger.
- Clear direction.
- Nice backing music.
- Social aspect.
- Feelings of autonomy.

In particular, your rewards should help what you are doing.
E.g. if I go to gym for a full month, week etc. Then I can reward myself with a new set of gym gear.

To implement this properly, I will have to think about it, maybe a journal or program?
