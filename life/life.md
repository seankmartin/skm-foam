## Cycles

We tend to work in cycles and with rhythms.
We have the circadian cycle, which helps us to sleep. Keep these cycles and tips for managing it in mind.

1. The circadian cycle is best set by sunlight. So head outside in the morning and the evening before sunset. Then, try to keep the lights in your environment low. 
2. We sleep in 90 minute cycles. So if aiming to wake at 7:30 the best sleep times would be 10:30, 12:00, and 1:30.
3. We are most ready for exercise when our body is warm. Our body has a natural temperature fluctuation. Some possible times would be 30 min after waking for exercise, then around lunch, and then in the evening.

## Meditation

Good resources are guided yoga nidra. Yoga itself can be good too.

## Study practices
