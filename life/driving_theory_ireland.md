## TODO

- Check all questions answered wrong
- Check all questions have been answered

## Review list

- Review hand signals
- Review the penalty points
- Review blood alcohol related questions
- Review all tractor terms
- Review license types
- Review technical questions
- Review all questions with a number
- Review signs

### Hand signals

- Do not allow a distance of more than 4.5 metres between the vehicles in trailing.

- Longer broken white lines warn drivers to hazards such as restricted vision.
- Double broken white lines warn drivers or upcoming continuous white lines.
- A single broken yellow line along the side of the road indicates a hard shoulder.
