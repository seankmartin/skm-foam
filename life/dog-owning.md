# Dog Owning

## Daily routine

Make sure to spray the balcony and show it to the dog every day to try and get them to pee there.

## Crate training

- Don't let them get out of the routine of being crate trained for sleeping.
- Don't punish them in the crate, since that is where we want them to sleep.
- Try to put their food near their crate so that they like the crate.
- Start to leave them in the crate for short amounts of time so that they will get used to that.
- Leave the door to the crate open so that they will go in and out of it as they please.
