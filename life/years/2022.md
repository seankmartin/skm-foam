# 2022 - a year in review

Some bits and bobs from 2022.

## Video games played

| Game | Rating | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| **Before Your Eyes** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Amazing experience, very moving. The idea of controlling with eye blinks is very novel. |
| **Elden Ring** (PS5) | ★★★★★ | Fantastic game, really enjoyed the almost 100 hour playtrough. The combat, visuals, story etc. come together really nicely, it is great. |
| **TOEM** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | A really cute game about taking pictures :) |
| **Rogue Legacy 2** (PC) | ★★★☆☆ | The gameplay is pretty solid, but it starts to feel kind of dull quite fast. |

## Movies and TV shows watched

| Movie | Rating | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Interstellar** (2014) | ★★★★★ | Murph! |
| **The Imitation Game** (2014) | ★★★★★ | Fantastic movie. A little bittersweet due to the misrepresenation of some real life characters though. |
| **The Batman** (2022) | ★★★★☆ | Brilliantly made movie, but it is extremely grim. Feels a bit like playing power grid, is it really fun? |
| **Moon Knight** (2022) | ★★★★☆ | Very well made, moving character lines. The inclusion of the Egyptian gods is pretty cool too. Something about it felt slightly off, but it is good. |
| **Only Murders in the Building** (2021) | ★★★★☆ | Actually really good! Some of the humour is a bit off I think, but overall a great mix of real suspense and genuinely good comedy. |

## Books read

| Book | Rating | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| **Sparkling Cyanide - Christie** (1944) | ★★★★☆ | A thrilling read, everyone has motives. Probably not the most interesting of Christie's works, but a very strong one. |
| **The Spike - Humphries** (2021) | ★★★★☆ | A very solid account of how spikes are formed and what they enable, with well placed humour so that you are not just reading a text book. |
