# 2020 - a year in review

A strange year, but here is what I did.

## Video games played

| Game | Rating | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| **Sekiro** (PS4) | ★★★★★ | Amazing game, incredibly smooth combat. Completed it three times, but still have nightmares about monkeys. |
| **Bloodborne** (PS4) | ★★★★☆ | A great game, but framerate issues, some unsatisfying bosses, and lack of diversity keeps it from 5 stars. |
| **Darksiders Genesis** (PS4) | ★★★☆☆ | Fun combat but extremely repetitive with uninteresting puzzles. |
| **FIFA 17** (PS4) | ★★★☆☆ | Hilarious story mode that would have been genuinely fun if it wasn't so drawn out. |
| **Oxygen Not Included** (PC) | ★★★☆☆ | Fun, but very frustrating and a large time sink. |
| **Deep Rock Galactic** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Rock and stone brother. |
| **Shards of Infinity** (PC) | ★★★☆☆ | Might be four stars if I didn't like Ascension so much. |
| **Astroneer** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Extremely fun game loop, but the game feels unfinished and is broken in multiplayer. |
| **Disco Elysium** (PC) | ★★★☆☆ | Starts strong, finishes weak. |
| **Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales** (PC) | ★★★☆☆ | Would have been great if it was not so drawn out. The story is fantastic but the battles are trivial, yet very long. |
| **Littlewood** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | An absolute blast at the start, but the game gets grindy faster than desired. |
| **XCOM 2** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Amazing strategy game that carries weight with every action taken. Would recommend turning on settings to speed up the game and installing some quality of life mods. |
| **Middle-earth: Shadow of War** (PC) | ★★☆☆☆ | I can't help but feel I've played this all before in Shadow of Mordor. |
| **Islanders** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Fun minimalistic building game at a low price. |
| **Monster Hunter: World** (PC) | ★★★★☆ | Amazing fights with equally amazing monsters, pity the story is so bad. |
| **Hades** (PC) | ★★★★★ | Incredibly fun roguelike, can't wait for the full release of the game. |

## Movies watched

| Movie | Rating | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Arrietty** (2010) | ★★★☆☆ | Very pretty but a dull story. |
| **The Cat Returns** (2002) | ★★★★★ | Wild. |
| **Jaws** (1975) | ★★★★☆ | Boring story but great characters. |
| **Jumanji: The Next Level** (2019) | ★★★☆☆ | Funny moments but felt stale after the first movie. |
