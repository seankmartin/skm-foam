# Driving

## Key things

- The test takes 45 minutes, it is BW, and I need 35 / 40 to pass.
- I need to arrive at least 30 minutes before the test, and I need my passport.
- I need to wear a mask for the full test.

## Rules of the road

- Vehicles on road must have a minimum of 1.6mm tread depth over the main treads. For motorcycles and vintage vehicles it is 1mm.
- In speed zones of up to 50kmh at least 1 metre should be kept for passing cyclists. In over 50kmh zones you should keep a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
- You can overtake on the left if the driver in front of you has moved out and signalled that they are turning right.
- Do not allow a distance of more than 4.5 metres between the vehicles in trailing.
- Typically car headlights let you see for 100 metres. Dipped lights only see about 30 metres and a car travelling at 100 kmh will cover this distance in about a second.
- Longer broken white lines warn drivers to hazards such as restricted vision.
- Double broken white lines warn drivers or upcoming continuous white lines.
- A single broken yellow line along the side of the road indicates a hard shoulder.
- A flashing amber arrow pointing left means you can move past the traffic light but only if you give way to traffic already coming through the junction on the other road.
- In wet weather, double the two second rule saying, and in severe conditions, repeat is 4 or 5 times.
- An 80kmph can be four diagonal black lines.
- 30kmph, 12m stopping, 40kmph, 18m, 50kmph, 25m, 80kmph, 52m, 100kmph, 70m, 120kmph, 102m.
- In wet conditions, 20kmph 9m, 30kmph 16m, 40kmph 25m, 50kmph 36m, 60kmph 49m, 70kmph 64m, 80kmph 81m, 100kmph 121m, 120kmph 169m.
- Hit by car at 60kmph, 9/10 die, 50kmph, 5/10 die, 30kmph 1/10 die.
