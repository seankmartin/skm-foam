# Atomic habits

## Habit formation

Habits consist of a cue, a craving, a response, and a reward.
E.g. You see an ad for crisps, you crave the crisps, you eat the crisps, and the reward is that you feel good.

The problem is that these habits can get associated. If that ad is near your work, then going to work and eating crisps can become associated with eachother.

A prime example of this for me is:

1. You hit a stumbling block on a project at work.
2. You feel stuck and want to relieve your frustration.
3. You play video games.
4. You feel relieved. Playing video games becomes associated with feeling stalled at work.

### Good Habit

1. Cue (Make it obvious)
2. Craving (Make it attractive)
3. Response (Make it easy)
4. Reward (Make it satisfying)

### Bad Habit

1. Cue (Make it invisible)
2. Craving (Make it unattractive)
3. Response (Make it difficult)
4. Reward (Make it unsatisfying)

## Law 1 - Make it Obvious

Self explanatory - make it obvious.
If you want to read, at night, place a book on your pillow.
If you want to make sure to eat more fruit, keep the fruit visible.

To know your habits, write them out on a habit scorecard.
You can point and call to move away from nonconcious habits.

E.g. I'm about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.
Or, Tomorrow I need to go the post office after lunch.
Vocalising it helps you.

In a similar vein, your habits that you want to build need to be very specific.
To leverage this, use implementation intentions. So when situation X arises I will do thing Y.
Key - I will BEHAVIOUR at TIME in LOCATION.

A good way to build habits is by habit stacking. Placing a new habit on top of a habit that you already do.
Key - After CURRENT HABIT, I will NEW HABIT.
However, this can also be with cues. For example.
When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don't know yet.
OR, When I buy a new item, I will give something away (One in, one out.)

You need to set up your environment for success on these habits to make it obvious. I think this is a big one for me, a clear space is a clear mind for instance.
Overall it is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
An important one here is digital spaces. For instance I could always to my writing on my Jen's laptop to get into the habit of it (and I like the keyboard anyway).

This all applies in the converse for breaking bad habits. You need to make them invisible. Life is not about self-control, but about managing the things that tempt you to do bad things so that you don't need to display as much self control.
For instance, if you play too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.

### Examples

- I will meditate for one minute at 7am in my kitchen.
- I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 pm in my bedroom.
