# Todo

## Work

- [ ] Check reviewer comments on ER work. Mail Shane about these.
- [ ] PhD thesis
- Check the Abbott edited series

## Beth LFP

- Can I normalise theta to speed (don't know)
- Data inspection
- Code TODOs
- Papers check
- Check Speed LFP in muscimol
- Finish off the t-maze splits and analyse
- Compare an analysis from elephant? E.g. spike LFP ([elephant.sta.spike_triggered_average â€” Elephant 0.10.0 documentation](https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/_toctree/sta/elephant.sta.spike_triggered_average.html#elephant.sta.spike_triggered_average))
- Select final list of recordings
- Figure out about missing LFPs related to spikes
- Spike shuffling for STA
- Theta in CA1
- Why RSC differences in the latter group.
- Use only the LFP that can be found.
- Deal with how to allow concsiously saying "Work with whatever data is there", but not allowing for unconcious missing data??

## Website

- Upload a pandas cheat sheet OR build some commonly used functions into my PythonUtils module!
- Finish my review of games in 2020 and start a new one for 2021.
- Add Joao Semedo to the list of researchers
- Keep in mind who else might be recent PhD students for this matter, and similar to Semedo in the same field.

## Papers

- Properly read the neuroscientist microprocessor paper.
- Read and make final decision on the stats papers (e.g. Semedo).
