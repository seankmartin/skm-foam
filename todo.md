## Meeting 07/02/2022

- Review inbox
- Print and gather info on projects and thesis.
- Show draft layout of connect paper + any others.
- Prepare a plan of meeting.

## List with timelines (rough guide)

1. Have redraft of prob connection paper and the bits for ER by end of next week (inc weekend) so Jan 30.
2. Have application to Allen and 2 references finalised by Jan 31.
3. Synthesise recent LFP work by others and consolidate these ideas with what we may be seeing in the ATNx SUB study. Write rough interpretation in thesis, and get it out of my headspace for now. That should be only a week max so Feb 6.
4. Submit to review for neurochat (the small one with the new link to the file etc.) so I can mention it in progress meeting. A small level of effort Feb 6.
5. Clean up my writing on the open data, and start analysing even basic stats on the most promising set. This is a reasonably sized task, but for something basic maybe 2-3 weeks including updating my software tool in tandem. So Feb 27
6. At this point, I'd probably want to focus on my progress meeting as it is in two weeks. So a lot of Thesis writing, submitting loose papers or reviews in case they fall through the cracks of this plan(?) preparing a presentation etc. Mar 11
7. The progress meeting won't take all the time over that two weeks, so should have time also for whatever project is most pressing starting in Mar.

## Neurochat

1. Check if the windows exe built from my laptop works with some actual data.
2. If so, rebuild to incorporate any final changes.

## Other tasks

- Finish JASP review (1 week - Feb 7)

## Work

- Check the Abbott edited series.
- What already exists in terms of possible ensemble detection / interaction.
- Include analysis methods in analysis methods doc.
- One sentence summaries of my research works.

## Connectivity paper

Short term plan:

1. Compare figure names in results folder to those in produce figures code file.
2. Check D=1, =2, =3 on new sets.
3. Integrate old appendix info into thesis.
4. Plan and code final experiments.
5. Test the plots for these where possible on smaller sets of data.
6. Run the tests.
7. Incorporate results into paper and write up results + improve methods etc.

Long term changes:

- Cite this <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438817303161?via%3Dihub#bib0545> (Steinmetz on challenges - mentions studying connected neurons) and the related.
- This needs to be included <https://direct.mit.edu/netn/article/3/1/217/2194/High-resolution-data-driven-model-of-the-mouse> (Our model relaxes the assumption of homogeneity of connections within a region and instead assumes smoothness across major brain divisions)
- Watch my two videos about this in Gdrive and incorporate the information from them.
- Put visp and visl together in left hemi on OSF. And way to pick left or right in code in matrix.py.

## Beth LFP

- Update the paper.
- Combine Matheus code with mine and think about how to share data.

## Website

- Finish my review of games in 2020 and start a new one for 2021.
- Add Joao Semedo to the list of researchers
- Keep in mind who else might be recent PhD students for this matter, and similar to Semedo in the same field.
- Make a short article about some of my code bases.

## Papers

- Properly read the neuroscientist microprocessor paper.
- Read and make final decision on the stats papers (e.g. Semedo).
