## Written plan

The utmost priority is to finish the investigation of the open datasets and get that repository set up.
Following on from this I need to collect hypotheses and see which would be most interesting to investigate.
Then gather the analysis methods together and think of what would need to be created new.
This would involve gathering together the ideas from the books etc. 
And would be a nice wrap up from there.

Then I need to update my plan for my thesis and send it on to Shane.

Following on from this I need to finish my paper(s).

From there, I need to regather and fix up my notes, my github repository, website etc.
Basically get what I can ready to go so that I can crack on with these papers.
While doing this, I need to add and update where I can on my thesis.

Finally, getting cracking!
Coding / cleaning up code / writing thesis etc.
