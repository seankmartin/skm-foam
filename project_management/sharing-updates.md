# Sharing updates

When sharing progress updates with a client, it's essential to provide clear and concise information that effectively communicates your accomplishments, milestones, and any relevant challenges you may have encountered. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to share progress updates with a client:

1. Determine the frequency: Decide on the frequency of progress updates based on the project's timeline and the client's preferences. This could be weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on the project's scope and duration.

2. Identify key updates: Identify the most critical updates to share with the client. These may include completed tasks, milestones achieved, any roadblocks or challenges faced, and upcoming deliverables or deadlines.

3. Choose the right format: Select a format that suits both your project's needs and the client's communication preferences. Common options include email, project management tools, video conferences, or face-to-face meetings. Consider the client's preferred mode of communication and choose a method that facilitates clear and effective communication.

4. Provide a summary: Begin your progress update with a concise summary of the overall progress made since the last update. Highlight the key achievements and outcomes, focusing on what matters most to the client.

5. Break it down: Provide a breakdown of completed tasks, milestones, or goals achieved during the reporting period. Use bullet points or a numbered list to make it easier to read and comprehend. Include relevant details such as dates, deliverables, and any important metrics or measurements.

6. Address challenges and roadblocks: If you encountered any challenges or roadblocks during the reporting period, be transparent and explain them briefly. Describe how you addressed or plan to overcome these obstacles, highlighting your problem-solving skills and commitment to finding solutions.

7. Outline upcoming activities: Detail the upcoming tasks, milestones, or deliverables that the client can expect in the next reporting period. Include estimated timelines or deadlines for these activities to manage expectations effectively.

8. Seek feedback and clarification: Encourage your client to provide feedback, ask questions, or seek clarification on any aspect of the project. This promotes open communication and ensures everyone is on the same page.

9. Attach supporting documents: If applicable, attach relevant documents, reports, or visuals that support your progress update. These may include graphs, charts, or project status reports to provide a visual representation of your progress.

10. Summarize next steps: Conclude your progress update by summarizing the next steps or actions required from both parties. Clarify any specific requests or tasks that the client needs to address, and confirm your availability for further discussions or meetings.

11. Follow up: After sending the progress update, follow up with the client to ensure they received it and address any questions or concerns they may have. This demonstrates your commitment to effective communication and client satisfaction.

Remember, effective progress updates should be informative, transparent, and aligned with the client's expectations. Regular communication helps build trust and ensures that both you and the client are on track to achieve project goals.
