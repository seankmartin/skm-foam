# Task estimation support

Asking your team-mates to estimate the time it will take to complete a set of tasks can be a delicate process, but there are ways to support them in this task. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Explain the importance of task estimation: Before you ask your team-mates to estimate the time it will take to complete a set of tasks, it's important to explain why this is necessary. Explain that accurate time estimates help with project planning and ensure that deadlines are met.

2. Provide clear instructions: Make sure your team-mates understand what you are asking for. Clearly describe the tasks that need to be estimated and provide any necessary details about the project or deadlines.

3. Encourage collaboration: Ask your team-mates to work together to estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks. This can help ensure that everyone's input is heard and that estimates are as accurate as possible.

4. Use previous data: If you have completed similar tasks in the past, use that data to inform your estimates. This can help your team-mates understand the scope of the tasks and give them a starting point for their estimates.

5. Provide support: Be available to answer any questions your team-mates may have as they work on their estimates. Encourage them to ask for help if they need it.

6. Review the estimates: Once your team-mates have provided their estimates, review them together as a team. Discuss any discrepancies and work to reach a consensus on the estimated time.

7. Adjust the plan as necessary: Based on the estimated time, adjust the project plan and deadlines as necessary. Communicate any changes to the team and stakeholders.

By following these steps, you can support your team-mates in estimating the time it will take to complete a set of tasks, and ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.
